This serves as a snapshot of the bettergedcom.wikispaces.com site, which was discontinued sometime in 2016.

The `browsable/` folder is intended to be usable as-is (once checked out; github does not support html-file browsing) as a navigable snapshot of the final state of that site.
Explicit links to comments and discussions have not been repaired (yet; in theory this is possible from some other data I have on hand, but it's more work than I've done so far).
`browsable/index.html` is a custom-made index page and not part of the original site.

There were a few comments attached to images and the now-unavailable page `Chat.html`, which have not (yet) been included in this backup.
