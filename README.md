This serves as a snapshot of the bettergedcom.wikispaces.com site, which was discontinued sometime in 2016.

The browsable/ folder is intended to be usable as-is as a navigable snapshot of the final state of that site.
Explicit links to comments and discussions have not been repaired (yet; in theory this is possible from some other data I have on hand, but it's more work than I've done so far).
There also was no obvious index, landing page, or other jumping-off point for navigating the site, and I have not yet created one.

Furthermore, there were a few comments attached to images and/or a now-unavailable page "Chat", which have not (yet) been restored in the browsable folder.
