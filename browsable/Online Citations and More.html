 <br />
Various technologies exist or are emerging that support the capture of essential online citation information. BetterGEDCOM intends to use it's standard Citation Element and Citation Template schemes and other technologies to advance the capture of online citations. Perhaps one day, visitors to genealogy centric sites will transfer essential citation information to a user's application via a BetterGEDCOM UUID?<br />
<br />
<strong>The Technologies.</strong> Mark Tucker, <em>ThinkGenealogy</em>, wrote a series of articles for his blog in 2009, &quot;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thinkgenealogy.com/better-online-citations/" rel="nofollow">A Better Way to Cite Online Sources</a>.&quot; He looked at various technologies including <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thinkgenealogy.com/2009/06/20/better-online-citations-marc/" rel="nofollow">MARC</a> [Machine-Readable Cataloging], <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thinkgenealogy.com/2009/06/20/better-online-citations-marc-xml/" rel="nofollow">MARC XML</a> and <span class="wiki_link_ext"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thinkgenealogy.com/2009/06/22/better-online-citations-mods/" rel="nofollow">MODS</a></span> [Metadata Object Description Schema].<br />

<br />
<strong>Reference Management Applications:</strong> One or more steps removed from the broad technologies reviewed by Mark Tucker are various reference management applications (aka, citation management software or bibliographic management software). These are programs like <em>RefWorks</em>, <em>Endnote</em> or <em>Zotero</em>. See <em>Wikipedia</em>, &quot;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software" rel="nofollow">Comparison of reference management software</a>.&quot; These applications import citation element-like data in different file formats (like MODS), allow for the further formatting management of that data within the application (ala, templates), and also export the data. [1] <br />
<br />
Since not long after BetterGEDCOM was organized, we've mentioned <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zotero.org/" rel="nofollow">Zotero</a> as an interesting application. It is free, cross platform, open source, will have a multilingual component (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zotero.org/blog/new-release-multilingual-zotero-with-duplicates-detection/" rel="nofollow">experimental now</a>). [1] Zotero &quot;supports copy/paste or drag-and-drop&quot; of references into both <em>Microsoft Word</em> and <em>OpenOffice.org Writer</em>. [1] <br />

<br />
<strong>Zotero.</strong> This particular reference management application supports various <a class="wiki_link" href="Modern%20Style%20Guides.html">Styles</a> including <a class="wiki_link" href="Modern%20Style%20Guides.html#CMOS">Chicago Manual of Style</a>/<a class="wiki_link" href="Modern%20Style%20Guides.html#Turabian">Turabian</a>, <a class="wiki_link" href="Modern%20Style%20Guides.html#APA">APA</a>, <a class="wiki_link" href="Modern%20Style%20Guides.html#MLA">MLA</a>. A listing of the styles Zotero now reportedly supports can be viewed on its, &quot;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zotero.org/styles" rel="nofollow">Zotero Style Repository</a>.&quot; Unfortunately, Zotero does not yet support genealogy-centric styles, <a class="wiki_link" href="Modern%20Style%20Guides.html#Mills">Mills</a> (or <a class="wiki_link" href="Modern%20Style%20Guides.html#Richard S. Lackey">Lackey</a> ) for example. It's not that users of Zotero haven't asked for support, they have. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] It's not that Zotero doesn't have volunteers willing to help, they do! [7]<br />
<br />
Zotero and its volunteers need the style information presented in a systematic way (who doesn't). They have a process called &quot;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zotero.org/support/requesting_styles" rel="nofollow">requesting styles</a>.&quot; Essentially, you select an existing Zotero style, something similar but different. [For genealogical citations, I'm guessing CMOS is the closest of the Zotero styles.] Then, from the Zotero &quot;requesting style&quot; page, &quot;itemize the precise differences that need to be implemented to make that existing style into the style you need.&quot; For lack of a better term, Zotero needs a &quot;whole template&quot; comparison (citation elements associated with citation templates). <br />

I just can't go to Ancestry.com, or any of the thousands of genealogy websites and download into Zotero, because it doesn't work. In fact, the largest genealogy library in the world, with millions of items in the catalog, doesn't download anything into Zotero. It all has to be entered manually. Genealogy citations contain much more detail than any other discipline. It'd be nice if just one of the hundreds of available Zotero citations were sufficient, but they're not, so I have to do all sorts of customizing to get Zotero to output the citations demanded by my clients. ...isn't a software program in existence that produces an adequate citation to meet the industry standard as found in Elizabeth Shown Mills book, &quot;Evidence Explained ...&quot; and/or to satisfy the demands of my various clients. So I use Zotero and am glad that it's available.&quot; <br />

The bibliography would also include the date the book was published to the web. Note that there are two &quot;titles&quot; both of which are italicized. Has anyone worked with such a citation, or perhaps created one? Is it possible to create an online book image under the Chicago Style or does it require a new style?&quot;<br />

I really have no time to do all the ground work. If this is something important I need this in a systematic way ...&quot;
