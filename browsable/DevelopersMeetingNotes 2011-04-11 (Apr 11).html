<strong>Meeting Notes</strong><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><a class="wiki_link" href="Definitions.html">Definitions</a> Moderator: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wikispaces.com/user/view/ttwetmore" rel="nofollow">ttwetmore</a> <span style="color: red;">resigned</span></span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in;"><em>“My vision for Better GEDCOM is at odds with some others.</em> </span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in;"><em>The issue is whether BG should be a modification to GEDCOM that allows the current generation of software products to better share their data,</em></span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in;"><em>or whether BG should be a model for the next generation of products, supporting both today's features, but also going to the next step of supporting record and evidence based applications, and applications that will interface with large data providers.</em> </span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in;"><em>BG was apparently formed to solve the former problem.</em></span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in;"><em>I and some others have been pushing to go further and solve the latter.</em> </span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in;"><em>I don't believe that solving the first problem will have any impact on the genealogical industry, and that, if BG is to have a lasting impact, it must address the second.”</em></span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Andy -</strong> Tends to agree with Tom. Fix what’s wrong with current GEDCOM, but expansion for future evidence-conclusion won’t appeal to developers. The developers need an out on the other end. Wants to see both problems handled today. Take the whole package.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Tamura -</strong> Tom is participating in OpenGen, and they are receptive to the evidence-conclusion model. </span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Sandy –</strong> Part of the issue for getting BG adopted. If it was easy to go forward with more evidence-based model, it would have been done already. Repository existing docuements. Ability of vendors to move forward and to see a need to depart from their current defensive mind-set. And the only way to (possibly) get them to change – would be to support an evidence-conclusion model. If you look at the software out there – different source templates. None currently support evidence-based model. Vendors from major tree software must participate.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Roger –</strong> Ultimately an evidence-conclusion is far away – but ultimately the [goal]. Vendors add evidence basis tags and change in user interface as well as line data structure. .bettergedcom is a good start and evidence conclusion is the BetterGEDCOM future.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Michael –</strong> is a developer, working on a program. What he wants in BetterGEDCOM is something where everyone agrees. We may get more developers if there is something at BetterGEDCOM. Data model. There is a lot of talk – theoretical stuff. But without a model there is no possibility. [He responded to Tom’s data model specifications.] If we want to interest developers. FamilyPursuit.com - he sees his product as conclusion-centric.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Roger –</strong> People say “I bought Mac, importing GEDCOM into Reunions and now some of my data is lost.”</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Geir –</strong> talking about creating a model. A complete model of BG standard will cover more than evidence-conclusion. Should we give priority to evidence-conclusion? Not saying we should. How do we know that this evidence-conclusion stuff is what vendors want to discuss? </span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>GeneJ –</strong> Smart science – (per Adrian’s post to the wiki <a class="wiki_link" href="http://message.wikispaces.com/-/view/Research%20Process%2C%20Evidence%20%26%20GPS/37470240">message/view/Research+Process%2C+Evidence+%26+GPS/37470240</a> ). Feels if we go too far, we go back to a GEDCOM 1.0.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Geir –</strong> One high level consideration – if we do not get the vendors on board, why are we here at all? Either we get them on board, or reassign our short term goal. Map the requirements. One possibility. Count how many people who are currently working on this – five. We aren’t going to create the standard. If only five? What will be useful in the future?</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Geir –</strong> the other concern over the last few weeks. Being pulled in various directions by three people to work on other parts of the wiki. </span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Tamura –</strong> reality check:</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> Tom seems both right and wrong to me.</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> Having a good model is important, but current problems are not unimportant.</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> I think he would agree with that, but just does not agree with the</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> priorities other gives to some issues.</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> Fact is, different people have different perspectives.</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> Different perspectives is good, it brings a rich variety of ideas to the table.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> It is important for BetterGEDCOM to have some *focus*.</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> BetterGEDCOM activity all over the place; every addresses what they</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> see as a problem</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> You are addressing 15 years of neglect, so there is no lack of issues to address</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> BetterGEDCOM aims to solve the issues</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> You cannot solve everything at once</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> You will have to make multiple versions</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> You need to make choices, and not everyone is going to agree with the choices</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> To really move forward, you need to make choices what to do first.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Michael –</strong> If we don’t get the vendors on board. The most useful part of the wiki is the Requirements Page. He can solve the problems now that he knows what they are. Then the data model.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Roger –</strong> Ran Tamura’s torture tests using Reunions. Level 2 or Level 3 tag… recommend to vendors changes that can work. Moving toward Louis Kessler and Tom Whitmore’s suggestions.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Geir –</strong> Re: Mike’s comments on Requirement’s Page, if it is the priority. It may at some stage cover all the issues, so that will not be a way to prioritize. Fixing the existing problems – they should be done in the light of the future. </span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Sandy –</strong> No reason why approach cannot be split into multiple levels. Form smaller group – immediate issue today (some are deliberate.)</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;">1 – Immediate issues – define fixes to communicate.</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"> 2 – Evidence Conclusion Model</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>GeneJ –</strong> Tamura mentioned 15 years of neglect. Roger – testing on existing software. We could test until the cows come home. Enough testing to ID main issues, well documented. Another group works on solutions. </span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Tamura –</strong> Some vendors will immediately fix, some ignore. Get some other blogger to do a positive review. Reviewers who give only positive reviews are also part of the problem. More testing (real reviews) is good. Real tests – real opinions. </span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Michael –</strong> Reading the wiki page “What is BetterGEDCOM about?” Page described problems only, he felt he would find a data model. [Not interested in remaking old – looks to future.]</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Geir –</strong> Possible priorities. Also consider [calendaring] priorities so every few weeks we hit on a topic of interest to some wiki participants.</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol; font-size: 10pt;">· </span>Requirements</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol; font-size: 10pt;">· </span>Data model</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol; font-size: 10pt;">· </span>Record structure</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal; text-indent: -0.25in;">(Comment on the minutes from Geir : I don't remember why I mentioned these 3, but did not mean that we should work eg. 2 weeks on Reqs, then 2 weeks om the model, and so 2 on records.)</span><br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;">First step on evidence-conclusions – call the new page BetterGEDCOM Evidence-Conclusion model (not DeadEnds in the name.) Create common starting point for that discussion. (Comment from Geir: I said we need to create a table of content to previos discussin on E&amp;C as a starting point.)</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>GeneJ</strong> – We need concrete examples when discussing.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="line-height: normal;"><strong>Geir</strong> – If we’re going to go forward with this. A few days ago Tom posted that FamilySearch is doing something according to GenTech. I feel we have to go forward with Evidence-Conclusion with an open mind.</span><br/>

<div class="title">Developers Meeting 11 April 2011</div>
<div class="text">Sounds like it was the best meeting yet. Maybe some direction will come out of this.<br/>
<br/>
Too much running around in different directions. We all have different ideas. And nothing will get done if there's no real concrete measureable goal. I'm not talking about the ones that says "BG should be ...". I'm talking about things like "Implement a Level 0 Evidence Structure".<br/>
<br/>
With just a few people, I think BG should work on just one problem at a time, and come up with a concrete extension to GEDCOM that is a solution to that problem. That will be progress and will stimulate the next improvement.<br/>
<br/>
But trying to fix everything at once is a recipe for spinning wheels.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. I'm not avoiding. I'm just very busy.<br/>
