(10 Nov 2010) “…how to develop a data model,” Greg (from Tom)<br />
BG Data Model Discussion (page) &gt; discussion (17 replies; 176 views)<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="message/view/BG+Data+Model+Discussion/29953781%2329970093" rel="nofollow">message/view/BG+Data+Model+Discussion/29953781#29970093</a><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">“Should the model be built from the bottom up (requirements), or should we use an existing model as a starting point….” Xvdessel writes, “ the first key decisions will most likely be around the scope: does the model cover only conclusion data with reference to sources (like GEDCOM does) or do we want to extend it to source data elements, the decision process, and the resulting conclusions.”</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">In part, “Do we want BG to be a system just used for recording conclusions - pretty much as GEDCOM is now? (Then the question arises - do we want to allow alternative conclusions to be recorded, e.g. for births, even though clearly someone is only born once) … And / or do we want BG to record evidence and / or evidence management?” … gthorud comments, “One way or another, I think you must be able to handle both conclusions and evidence/theory info in the same standard … You may perhaps see both methods used in the same file.”</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">“How to vote” included much discussion on who should vote. “Meeting consensus” reached that “Item to be voted upon is put on the BetterGEDCOM wiki on a Monday. On the following Wednesday, the vote on that item is opened, remains open through that Friday, at which time the vote closes. Minimum 50% of eligible parties must vote for votes to be considered valid. If 75% of the valid votes are in favor (yes) or can live with it (yes, I can live with it), consensus will be deemed met; the issue is passed. We will try to design so those who vote are provided a short comment field. “</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">A proposed set of rules and guidelines for project management as proposal to discussion/debate and voting.

Comments, “a process must be directed by user requirements, or a description of what needs a solution satisfies. There has to be a formal procedure that ensures this, as in many ISO standard processes. The standard should not be based on technical solutions in search for a need, but there is also a need for technical excellence. <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10pt;">Somewhat opens about SourceTemplates.org, but then discusses organization in the context of BG. Geir writes, “</span><span style="color: #404040; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10pt;">what is needed first is a definition of the scope or goal of that work, detailed with a list of requirements to the solution. Then you need to find out who intends to participate in the work, and thirdly you need to decide how the work should progress and how decisions will be made etc. “ </span>Also poses the question of input and balance, transparency and openness, ownership and cost, international scope, whether the organization will perform real development.<br />
