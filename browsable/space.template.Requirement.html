<div class="text">I'd hate to see software mixed in unless it was a problem that ALL genealogy software suffers from. <br/>
<br/>
In particular I don't want to see specific suggestions for solving a specific problem of a specific application.<br/>

IMHO, neither BetterGEDCOM nor FHISO should be involved in that particular can of worms.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>bamcphee</strong> 2012-03-15T20:04:56-07:00</div>
<div class="text">As an example of something that may be able to be corrected that MOST software do incorrectly, would be the ALIA tag. Just thinking out with my fingers, I guess.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>Andy3rd</strong> 2012-03-15T20:43:37-07:00</div>

Usage of individual GEDCOM tags will, I believe, be covered by ID Data02 as described in the Requirements catalog,<br/>
<br/>
I see nothing to be gained at this point by a discussion of how each tag is used or misused. That discussion will probably take place later as the reference data model is developed.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>bamcphee</strong> 2012-03-15T22:16:17-07:00</div>

I appreciate that tag discussion is too early per se, my post was whether a new standard could also be used to 'correct/identify' errors made by software programs, similar to how a couple of programs currently do.<br/>
<br/>
I used ALIA only as an example of one tag not used correctly by many programs, that may be able to be corrected.<br/>

<div class="text">Tag discussion is too early? B-GEDCOM is 16 months old. At what time might it be proper to discuss tags. What is currently not too early to discuss?<br/>
<br/>
I wrote concise requirements for B-GEDCOM within weeks of its creation, requirements that were generally agreed with by the technical persons involved at the time. I proposed a model for B-GEDCOM for starting discussions about models within weeks of its creation. I provided detailed reviews of some other models to help set an initial context for discussion genealogical data models as a whole. Since then we've discussed formats for expressing requirements more than we discussed requirements. Now we've reopened requirements formats once again, with no real discussion on the actual requirements. As far as models go we've done nothing substantial.<br/>
<br/>
I continue to assume that the goal of B-GEDCOM is to develop a data model for genealogical data. Is this the generally accepted goal? After 16 months does anyone have any ideas as to why we not working on that goal?<br/>
<br/>
Talking about tags would at least get us thinking about data models a little bit, don't you think?</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>bamcphee</strong> 2012-03-15T22:44:35-07:00</div>
<div class="text">Tom<br/>
<br/>
My agreement with Andy re too early, was more I consider the wiki is not an ideal tool for general discussion, due to the poor search results and no appropriate page to discuss on anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I have suggested a forum and understand this may be announced soon.<br/>
<br/>
I consider that may be a better tool for discussion and the wiki would be the summary/agreement of decisions location.<br/>
<br/>
I am eager to ask (and have easy access to) questions for either now or future (or both) discussion, with solutions being incorporated on the wiki as the end result or recommendation.<br/>

My issues with B-GEDCOM are concerned with how ineffective it has become, which has nothing to do with your recent posts. Sorry you were in the crossfire.</div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>bamcphee</strong> 2012-03-15T19:55:05-07:00</div>

<div class="text">One or two sentences - use "must" if importance is mandatory; "should" if very desirable; "could" if desirable. This is the Proposer's idea.</div></div></body>
