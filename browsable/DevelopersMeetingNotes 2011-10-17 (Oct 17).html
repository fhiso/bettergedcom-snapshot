<br />
Comment:<br />
1. The meeting opened at 10 a.m. PDT<br />
<br />
2. Andy H. lost a family member overnight. He asked if there were any announcements and hoped we could facilitate discussions on other topics outside of the meeting proper.<br />
<br />
3. Item 1: <strong>May we have space on the Home page and the nav bar for &quot;Developing the Organization?&quot;</strong><br />
Discussion: It would be good to have obvious notice of this effort on the wiki. Andy, Roger and GeneJ thought the organizational part of the effort should advance.<br />
Action: GeneJ will create a home page discussion relative to this request that &quot;Developing the Organization&quot; have space on the Home page and Nav bar.<br />
<br />
4. Meeting notes: GeneJ will post meeting notes/notices.<br />
<br />
5. Meeting adjourned at 10:10 a.m. PDT.
