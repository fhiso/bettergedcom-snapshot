 The <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">International Organization for Standardization</a> (ISO) is a successful standards-setting body headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. ISO standards are developed around three principles--Consensus, Industry-wide, and Voluntary. Each standards setting process can be divided into <em>three phases</em>--(1) need and scope; (2) negotiated detailed specification/consensus building; (3) formal approval (my terms) that take the form of <em>six steps</em> (proposal, preparatory, committee, enquiry, approval and publication).[4] Various interim documents are published in the different points in time. [1] See also the graphic, &quot;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/processes_and_procedures/deliverables/deliverables_schema-2.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Schematic representation of ISO deliverables</a>.&quot; [3]<br />
<br />
The ISO's standards development work is &quot;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/governance_of_technical_work.htm" rel="nofollow">governed</a>&quot; by a &quot;Technical Management Board,&quot; responsible for establishing technical committees that conduct the work. It is this &quot;Technical Management Board&quot; that oversees the rules, guidelines and performance requirements of the organization (my words)--it keeps the standards work on track.<br />
<br />
During a 2010 and 2011 ISO review, the organization developed two documents I think of as the rules and guidelines for those who participate in establishing and maintaining ISO's rules and guidelines. These two documents, listed below, are discussed on ISO's website--see &quot;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/governance_of_technical_work.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Governance of technical work</a>.&quot; Both of the documents are downloadable from the ISO's website.<br />

The ISO website includes a nice series about the organization and the benefits of standardization (see <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/about.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">About ISO</a>). ISO publishes <em>ISO Focus+, a</em> magazine freely available from the organization website. See <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso-focus-plus_index.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ISO Focus+</a>. The July 2011 <em>ISO Focus+</em> issue contained a special section on how ISO develops standards, &quot;Cooking up successful standards.&quot;<br />

 <br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;">This Code of Conduct (Code) is to facilitate ISO's work which is carried out in an international, multi-stakeholder, multi-sector environment. It applies to people who choose to participate in an ISO committee, working group or other consensus group. The Code is an obligation for participation in the above groups that work in the framework of the ISO/IEC Directives.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;">As participants in ISO work, we acknowledge the responsibility and value of participating in developing International Standards. We therefore adhere to this Code in accordance with the terms below.</span><br />
