2011-01-31 17:02:50 [Message] dearmyrtle -&gt; Organizers Meeting: so if SOME people have the old version, it makes it a bad connection for everyone?<br />

2011-01-31 17:04:17 [Message] dearmyrtle -&gt; Organizers Meeting: as Tamura says --- it WAS successful... just not the outcome we desired.<br />
2011-01-31 17:04:24 [Message] TamuraJones -&gt; Organizers Meeting: Could try with updated Skype later. Just to make sure.<br />

dearmyrtle -&gt; Hello everyone!<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; looks like it's about that time.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; Here's what Tamura and I have been doing this past little while....<br />
GeneJ -&gt; Hi Myrt. Sorry to hear you aren't feeling well.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; 1. Added ourselves to our Skype Contacts....<br />
Andy_Hatchett -&gt; Yep.. Feeling better?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; 2. Worked with Google Wave...<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; and we're ready to do a test of the SKYPE I don't have Andy's skype name...<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; can you give it to me, then I will add you to my contacts.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
Andy_Hatchett -&gt; I don't Have a Skype name that I know of!<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; hello Tom...<br />
Andy_Hatchett -&gt; Just use agh3rd :)<br />
ttwetmore -&gt; hi<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; we're going to go over to SKYPE and test out that interface for a voice chat that can handle about 200+ attendees at no cost.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; tom do you have a skype account?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; My name there is DearMYRTLE<br />
ttwetmore -&gt; I may; I'll have to go through some stuff to remember<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; agh3rd is not a skype name<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; sorry Andy<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; Tamura and I have been experimenting, and I find Google Wave like that program you showed me GeneJ... where we could edit in real time.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; and see what the other one was typing.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; and still follow it over time.<br />
ttwetmore -&gt; looks like i do<br />
GeneJ -&gt; kk<br />
Andy_Hatchett -&gt; ok- just assign me one :) I don't even know how Skype works :)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; GeneJ what was that program.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; you have to download skype and register Andy.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; skype is free voice for multiple individuals<br />
GeneJ -&gt; Andy a busy boy!!<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I see you already have your other computer working.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; and then video for one-to-one.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; We actually started on time.<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; There is an Andy Hatchett in Skype. Evil twin?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; the purpose of this organizers meeting is to attempt to use SKPE<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; SKYPE<br />
Andy_Hatchett -&gt; Yes- unfortunately at the earlier meeting the video recorded great but no audio for some reason :(<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; and then Google Wave to see if that free space would be useful for our purposes.<br />
GeneJ -&gt; lol<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; good... I got a little teary-eyed there.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; andy are you in th eUK?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; or someone with the exact same name out of 789 million people on Skype.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; ok so Tom, did you find your skype account name?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I do like the idea of getting more done during our developers meetings -- voting on what is discussed and announced as voting for the next monday.<br />
GeneJ -&gt; agh3rd still not showing up when I search skype.<br />
ttwetmore -&gt; ttwetmore<br />
Andy_Hatchett -&gt; Am I supposed to do something- call a number or something?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I've scheduled a developers meeting for Monday the 7th since the 14this Valentine's day.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; OK....<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.skype.com" rel="nofollow">www.skype.com</a><br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; then download the program for your platform<br />
GeneJ -&gt; I found you, Tom; Tamura found me.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; then follow the screen prompts during the install to sigh up.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; sigh=sign up.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; sorry...<br />
GeneJ -&gt; &lt;&lt;is Marissab on Skype<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; tom I just sent you a request to add me to your contact list.<br />
GeneJ -&gt; I am marissab on skype<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; And once we get andy there,<br />
ttwetmore -&gt; (I have never used Skype, but it looks like I've just added three contacts)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; Hello Louis -- we're going to experiment on Skype.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; (WELCOME home from work!)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; ;)<br />
louiskessler -&gt; I've never used Skype either. I'll have to ask my daughter how to use it. :-)<br />
louiskessler -&gt; Are you using it now for this meeting?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I ahve Tamura, GeneJ, Russ and Tom in a group in my contact group<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; yes louis -- do you have skype...<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; our agenda calls for experimenting with skype for larger than 16 attendees ....<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; and to use the Wiki as a place to write.<br />
louiskessler -&gt; No. I don't have it yet. I can go to install it now.<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; ok- Firefox crashed :(<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; oh dear.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; that was my problem with Second Life last night. Some days are just like that.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; our goal is to find a cheaper alternative (free)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; rather than up my attendance to 100 max for another 50 bucjs per month.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I jsut spoke with tom via skype...<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; so he has it working just fine.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; didn't take long, did it?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; Louis -- did you see our meeting notes from this morning's Developers Meeting?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; we decided to do all voting on the wiki, so it isn't dependent on anyone's private survey monkey account -- or their schedule.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; we also agreed on the internationalization goal.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; we also agreed to have Mon by 5pm posting of proposed goals... (or other items to vote on)<br />
louiskessler -&gt; I missed the voting item (thought you were going to do it at the developers meeting).<br />
louiskessler -&gt; I saw the internationaliation goal accepted.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; with a link to that proposal page BACK ON THE AGENDA item.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; good.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; so you are fairly up to speed.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; We are attempting to make it possible for things NOT to come to a grinding halt when I am traveling.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I do so love to moderate --- slice through to the meat of things<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; and such<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; and see votes done in real time.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; unfortunately few can attend developers meetings<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; any more skype names to add? Louis -- Andy?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; ok- just added agh3rd to skype.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; GeneJ what was that website/program you showed me a while back<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; ?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; kk andy<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; now Louis... do you have your skype name?<br />
GeneJ -&gt; I'll pull it up .. believe it's typewith.me<br />
louiskessler -&gt; ... still installing<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; ok<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; no problem<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; Andy -- I just sent you a request to let me add you to my contact list on Skype.<br />
GeneJ -&gt; yes. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://typewith.me" rel="nofollow">http://typewith.me</a><br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; and the limit on Typewith.me is HOW many at a time?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; we are thinking Google Wave can handle a larger group viewing a page at once.<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; ok- see you and Tamura<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; but I could be wrong.... wasn't it something like 25 total? GeneJ?<br />
GeneJ -&gt; I don't know. You mentioned 25 earlier today<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; That numer sticks in my mind, yet their website isn't forthcoming ...let me look deeper.<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; Now what? do I click caL? VIDEO CALL??<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; Andy -- wait<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; Ok- i'm god at that :) har!<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I am waiting for lewis.<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; err--- good!<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; LOL<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; Louis.<br />
louiskessler -&gt; Arrrgh. I hate it when both lkessler and louiskessler are taken. But my Skype name is: louis.kessler<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; okie dokey<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; ok, as soon as you can accept me as a contact, I'll add you to the list.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; so we can practice the audio portion....<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; when all else fails come back to this room... OK everyone?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; ok, I see RUSS and LOUIS are not online with Skype... I don't think Russ is here anyway.<br />
GeneJ -&gt; 3rd party reports limit on Typewith.me is 15 persons.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; ok --- so that puts it out of the running....<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; thanks, Genej you found that very quickly.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I appreciate it.<br />
GeneJ -&gt; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nabt.org/blog/2010/07/31/type-with-me/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nabt.org/blog/2010/07/31/type-with-me/</a><br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; louis --- please accept my CONTACT invitation over on SKYPE... then await my call....<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I'll have all of you on the call at once... so no darth vader breathing. LOL.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; can you see where to accept my contact, Louis? (In Skype?)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; GeneJ I wonder why your little icon is red, and the rest of us are blue?<br />
GeneJ -&gt; donno<br />
louiskessler -&gt; Tom tried calling me. I heard him, but I saw my mike wasn't yet connected.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; kk<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; No video without webcam right?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; no video on group calls.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; to my knowledge --- its limited to one on one skype calls.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; are we ready?<br />
ttwetmore -&gt; yes, I tried to call Louis, heard nothing, so hung up.<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; I guess!<br />
ttwetmore -&gt; ready, i think<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; ok need tamura and andy<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; come on over to skype...<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; I am on Skype already...<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; i haveinitiated a call..<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; I see Tamura and Myrtle- I'm there aren't I?<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; Skype is not responding... LOL ...let's retry<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; I see Tom with a little phone headset :)<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; I am there now<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; Skype &quot;not responding again&quot;...<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; Welll- there was something therte for 30 seconds anyway!<br />
ttwetmore -&gt; got dumped<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; Dumped by Skype- again.<br />
GeneJ -&gt; kk<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; ok= back in room.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; wow -- that was a bit disconcerting wasn't it?<br />
GeneJ -&gt; Yes.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; It makes my goToMeeting.com interface sound OK after all...<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; I filled in the Skype feedback form<br />
GeneJ -&gt; tyty Tamura<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; good for you -- it isn't good for conference calls...<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; there are telephone conference call capabilitites...<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; with other services<br />
louiskessler -&gt; Do you think anyone at Skype will read the feedback form?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I've participated in large voice chats<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; involving placing a long distnace call.<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; It is multiple choice.... adds to their statistics.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I don't know Louis --- today FamilySearch sent me a deluge of emails from my feedback about their website problems in my blog post Sunday. So GO FOGURE.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; FIGURE.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; so what shall we do?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; If we go forward with the GoToMeeting larger meeting on my account, I'd trust several of you with logging in in my place if I were not able to attend.<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; The experiment was a success. We have a definite result; Skype is not good enough.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I just want this group to go forward with decision making even on days when I cannot attend.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; Good point&amp;gt;<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; thanks for participating in that tes.t<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; Like I said- I'll kick in $25/ mo if some other can pick up the rest and we go to the 100 person meeting toom level.'<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; ok, Andy, I'd give you my Login info then...<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; shall we consider that as an option?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; err-- I'm not sure that I'm the &quot;run-a meeting&quot; type- if you know what I mean :)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; not enjoying moderating?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; you don't have to moderate -- just open the doors for people so to speak.<br />
GeneJ -&gt; Does anyone have a paypal merchant account?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I don't.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I could set up a Google Checkout.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; (I hate paypal.)<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; I'll send Myrt the money direct- I won't use PayPal at all.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; kk<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; are we agreed to go forward with the larger room?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I will up my membership then....<br />
GeneJ -&gt; The larger room makes sense to me.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; and andy do you agree to open the doors ???? Sounds like we need another impartial observer to moderate.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; (my college debate team stuff is kicking in here!)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; it is hard for me to moderate -- as I am so opinionated.<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; ok- I'll open the doors ;)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; LOL<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; thakns, Andy.<br />
louiskessler -&gt; We're all opinionated.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I'll send you wikispaces email with my contact info<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; we need another 25$ us monthly... that is a lot of money.<br />
GeneJ -&gt; afk<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; LOL!! *You* are opinionated??? Have you ever read my Ancestry posts??? !!!!<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I think the pay pal or google cart to take up the slack might help.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; hehehehee.... I know! LOL.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; you should read Tamura's letter to Tim.<br />
louiskessler -&gt; To be honest, we shouldn't be putting in our own funds. We need a sponsor ... but still need to remain independent.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; yes, you should see Tamura's letter.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; to tim.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; OK -- so should we ask OpenGen to host our meetings?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; Vote you ALL....<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; this is the organizers meeting... we don't need full bg wiki approval.<br />
louiskessler -&gt; Yes.<br />
GeneJ -&gt; I vote that &quot;I can live with it&quot; if BG takes OpenGen up on generous offer.<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; &amp;lt;--- can live with anything... except Skype ;)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; good point.<br />
GeneJ -&gt; LOL<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; If you hadn't noticed yet, I never vote :-)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; you are opinionated AND non-voting -- wow, what a combination.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I am NOW SEEING that we should ask OPENGEN if they are still willing to host our BG Developers meetings.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
ttwetmore -&gt; can live with it unless it becomes clear we shouldn't<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; BEGIN log again.<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; No need to vote, is there? After all, my arguments sway you all ;-)<br />
GeneJ -&gt; )<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; This is the first time I have ever edited the log except to remove private comments betwene people (BTW I can see them all!)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; (in the log!)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; ok<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; nuff said on that.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; then we can go forth with the various<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; Edit all you want- I've got the recording ;)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; Agenda items<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; LOL<br />
louiskessler -&gt; I have to leave in 5 minutes<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; will be listed by the various wiki members who make proposal pages -- and link them.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; ok<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; and do we have any topics for consideration ... should I set up a meeting for Monday?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; so we don't lose any time?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; looks like most of our work will be decided in brief voting sessions<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; called developers meetings<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; with discussions on the wiki page discussion tab<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; for that topic<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; Oh- one thng!<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; tom --- shall we take your GOALS for discussion this coming week?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; or????<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; it is nearly 5pm Pacific time.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I can quickly add it to the agenda page.....<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; Since we now know the approx size of a recorded meeting I can look for a real home for them :)<br />
GeneJ -&gt; I have 500 PT meeting online.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; or do you wish a more studied approach.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; kk<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; looks like we need to adjourn....<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; tom -<br />
louiskessler -&gt; I can make a Feb 7 or Feb 21 meeting, but not Feb 14.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; can you hear me?<br />
GeneJ -&gt; So have to run. TYTY all. Hope you feel better, Myrt.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; (I mean see this)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; thanks<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; Tom?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; .<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; louis has to go as well.<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; Ooohhhh<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I guess this wraps it up.<br />
ttwetmore -&gt; here<br />
louiskessler -&gt; I work every second Monday (except when holidays mess them us), so I can make some Developer meetings.<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; message I see in Skype...<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; kewl.<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; The call host is using an old version of Skype.<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; Might be part of the problem.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; i just downloaded the Skype TODAY and installed it on this Windows 7.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; so how oculd it be the old version?<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; I downloaed it less than an hur ago!<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; I don't know. Just relaying what it reads there.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; OK, I won't kill the messenger.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; interesting, but weird.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; ok<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; Ah, that is for one of the retries involving some participants.<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; Some ppl have old version.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; so if SOME people have the old version, it makes it a bad connection for everyone?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; that is terrible.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; hmmmm<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; Everyon do Help | Check for Update...<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; well, I'll contact the OpenGen folks.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; right.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; &quot;You already have the latest version of Skype.&quot;<br />
louiskessler -&gt; I got that message as well (host using old version) on Skype.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; ok... I guess this wraps it up for today.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; thanks for experimenting<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; as Tamura says --- it WAS successful... just not the outcome we desired.<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; Could try with updated Skype later. Just to make sure.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I was the host.<br />
louiskessler -&gt; Do you have the latest version?<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; yes<br />
ttwetmore -&gt; getting latest now<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; I did as Tamura asked -- checked for update, and it says it is the latest.<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; That message did involve Tom...<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; oic<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; kk<br />
louiskessler -&gt; I've got to go now, but someone should check that Skype message on the Skype site or though Google. Maybe its something else and there is a solution.<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; just let me know where to send the money ;)<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; ok<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; meeting adjourned!<br />
Now_Recording -&gt; Says I have the latest update.<br />
ttwetmore -&gt; now running latest skpte<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; good<br />
louiskessler -&gt; Bye.<br />
dearmyrtle -&gt; niters everyone!<br />
TamuraJones -&gt; Bye<br />
ttwetmore -&gt; bye<br />
