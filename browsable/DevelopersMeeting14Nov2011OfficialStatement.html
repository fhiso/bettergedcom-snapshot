<span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 13.3333px;">OFFICIAL STATEMENT READ AT THE 14 Nov 2011 BetterGEDCOM Developers Meeting:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Today I meet with you to announce I am stepping aside as moderator of the BetterGEDCOM project to concentrate on other genealogy pursuits. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 13.3333px;">My goal today is to provide for a smooth transition and to applaud the phenomenal efforts of BetterGEDCOM participants. Here I have met talented people who have contributed worthwhile thought and a tremendous amount of time at BetterGEDCOM. </span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 13.3333px;">I have chosen to appoint Andy Hatchett as interim admin for BetterGEDCOM to give time for any remaining participants to reorganize as they wish. I will work with Andy tomorrow to provide for the transfer of BetterGEDCOM web properties.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Four of us set out to establish BetterGEDCOM on Nov 10th last year with the stated goal to develop an internationally-accepted standard for genealogy data archiving and transfer, and until January we were on a fact-finding mission to see who was up for the project. The subsequent organization of page moderators, development of a requirements catalog and a time line for creating a product and the institution of a sub-group project at SourceTemplates also provided ample space for bitter dispute among certain participants.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 13.3333px;">The concept of asking a volunteer organization to develop updated and forward-thinking standards for genealogy data storage and transfer was a noble one, perhaps doomed from the start. Creation of a standard and encouraging implementation by software and web developers just isn’t happening. Vendors must concentrate on meeting current customer needs.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 13.3333px;">At the very least, the BetterGEDCOM Project served to spotlight the issues with outdated genealogy file transfer protocols and lit a fire under several developers to ensure the data family historians collect about each ancestor isn’t lost as we share data with other researchers. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 13.3333px;">I wish BetterGEDCOM success as an influence in the industry, and feel fortunate to have become better acquainted with many of the members through our association this past year.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Respectfully submitted,</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Pat Richley-Erickson,</span><br />
