 <br />
Both Andy H and GeneJ experienced technical problems opening the meeting. (GTW returned messages to each saying they didn't appear online.) It took 20-30 minutes to develop a workaround. The meeting was opened at 10:15, but even then only the administrators and panelists were able to communicate. <br />
<br />
These technical difficulties will be resolved before the next Developers Meeting.<br />
<br />
Discussions:<br />
1) Survey Monkey. GeneJ will send out another notice via BetterGEDCOM wiki-mail, saying the survey will close at 5 PM Pacific today. Andy will close the survey during the organizers meeting today (at 5 PM-BetterGEDCOM chat room). [Wiki-mail sent]<br />
<br />
2) Over view of citation graphics.<br />
<br />
3) General discussion continued for the balance of the hour.
