 For many of us, <em>Citations</em> represent the record of <em>Evidence</em> for our conclusions; the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bcgcertification.org/resources/standard.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Genealogical Proof Standard </a>deals with evidence and conclusions and has an element, "Complete and accurate citation of sources." GEDCOM does <a class="wiki_link" href="Application%20Data.html">not transfer Citation data well</a>, so it does not transfer the record of our Evidence well. Post transfer, producing a simple Family Group Sheet can be a major undertaking.<br/>
<br/>
Separately, as our <a class="wiki_link" href="Application%20Overview.html">Application Overview</a> indicates, trends favor enabling interpretations of <a class="wiki_link" href="Modern%20Style%20Guides.html">Modern Style Guides</a>, especially those unique to genealogy. Technology exists or is emerging that allows users of other styles to capture essential citation information online.

 The <a class="wiki_link" href="Sources%20and%20Citations%20in%20GEDCOM.html">GEDCOM source system</a> is based a small group of <em>Citation Element</em>-like Data Fields (AUTH, TITL, PUBL, etc.). Many <em>Applications</em> have enabled a substantially larger groups of Citation Elements that further relate to <em>Citation Templates</em>. [See <a class="wiki_link" href="Application%20Overview.html#Application%20source%20systems%20functionality">Application Source Systems</a>] In order to export comparatively larger and/or more complex data to GEDCOM, Applications group Citation Elements together and associate those groups with GEDCOM's Data Fields or even custom tags. [See <a class="wiki_link" href="Application%20overview.html#Source%20Export">Application GEDCOM Export</a>] A receiving program has no assured way to interpret the details of the data on import; users must manually reconstruct parts or all of the citations.<br/>

<br/>
When fully implemented, BetterGEDCOM Applications will export all the data necessary for another BetterGEDCOM Application to reconstruct citations from both standard and non-standard Citation Elements and default, standard and non-standard Citation Templates. We have preliminarily identified six (6) requirements for this purpose. <strong>[Link to page - <a class="wiki_link" href="Fix%20the%20Transfer%20Problem.html">Fix the Transfer Problem</a>]</strong><br/>
<br/>
1. Establish an extended group of standard BetterGEDCOM Citation Elements, and<br/>
2. Determine the method by which an Application will define and export non-standard Citation Elements, and<br/>
3. Discover one or more standardized BetterGEDCOM Citation Templates, where at least one "default" template is based on GEDCOM's Data Fields, and<br/>
4. Determine the method by which Applications will export references to that/those standardized BetterGEDCOM Citation Templates, and<br/>
5. Discover ways by which Applications will define and export (or export references to) non-standard Citation Templates, and<br/>
6. Determine methods by which this comparatively larger export will be consistently interpreted by those Applications that are GEDCOM compatible but have not yet adopted BetterGEDCOM's model.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhat in the way <a class="wiki_link" href="GenTech%20Data%20Model.html">GENTECH</a> envisioned active management of it's data model, [1] BetterGEDCOM envisions active management of standard Citation Elements and Citation Templates. We have preliminarily identified one (1) requirement for this purpose:<br/>
<br/>
7. Provide means for active management of BetterGEDCOM standard Citation Elements, Citation Templates and the mechanisms by which references are transmitted.<br/>

<div class="title">Terry's TMG Tips, "Considerations for Exporting Sources to GEDCOM 5.5 Files."</div>
<div class="text"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2:http://tmg.reigelridge.com/Sources-exporting.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://tmg.reigelridge.com/Sources-exporting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://tmg.reigelridge.com/Sources-exporting.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2 --><br/>
<br/>
From the article, "The export is complicated, however, by the fact that TMG has far more Source Elements, or even Source Element Groups, than there are different tag types for sources in the GEDCOM specification. TMG deals with this by doubling up the information from several source elements into a single GEDCOM tag. But since there are no accepted standards for this "doubling up" process, various programs importing a GEDCOM file containing such combined tags will meet with varying degrees of success in satisfactorily placing the data in their own systems of recording source data. It is unlikely that the resulting source notes will read much at all like the source notes produced by TMG, even if the importing program successfully retains all the data included in the GEDCOM file."</div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>AdrianB38</strong> 2011-03-16T14:42:27-07:00</div>
<div class="text">Now _that's_ useful - it indicates the sort of data that TMG wants to capture - and shows the shortfalls of GEDCOM.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>GeneJ</strong> 2011-03-17T01:27:57-07:00</div>
<div class="text">While Legacy, RootsMagic, Family Tree Maker and others approach the development of the templates a little differently than TMG, the same concept of "doubling up" seems being used to transfer information to GEDCOM. <br/>
<br/>
As Terry points out, at the citation level (reference note), there are essentially two elements recognized by GEDCOM--PAGE and NOTE. The balance of the reference note is transferred as the source definition, as below.<br/>
<br/>
At the source level, Terry reports about five more: <br/>
<br/>
AUTH<br/>
TITL<br/>
ABBR TITL<br/>
NOTE<br/>
PUBL<br/>
CALN<br/>
<br/>
When a repository is reported, there are a few couple more elements. <br/>
<br/>
Adrian wrote, "it indicates the sort of data that TMG wants to capture..."<br/>
<br/>
Actually, TMG comes pre-packaged with even more citation/source data fields* and users can also add more. In order to fit the information into GEDCOM, however, each data field in TMG must be assigned to one of the Source Element Groups Terry has listed in his article.<br/>
<br/>
*For example, TMG doesn't have a Source Element Group for the WWW components of an online source; you also don't see a Source Element Group for "Source of the Source."</div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>GeneJ</strong> 2011-03-16T11:30:17-07:00</div>

"The conclusion I've found - at least with these three programs [FTM2011, RootsMagic, Legacy Family Tree 7] - is that ... Using a GEDCOM file to export data from one program and import it into another program will result in the loss of all Source Template information.  The resulting source templates are "Free-form" after the program interprets the GEDCOM data that is provided.

Italics is another example of formatting. It is not data. This is the same as number 2. The receiving program should do your formatting."<br/>
<br/>
Louis, how is the receiving program to know if the data in TITL is (a) the published title of a work, (b) the quoted title of an unpublished work or (c) a generic title you have chosen for the item?<br/>
<br/>
Louis also writes, "1. Putting all info into one field is wrong. Reading programs will not be able to interpret what is there. The various parts of the source citation must be identified, and placing them in the various fields: Author, Title, Publication, etc. is the way that reading programs can understand what is there."<br/>
<br/>
I agree, but where are the fields in GEDCOM? For example, were is my field for website owner, website page name, URL, access date and keyword? Where are my title fields for the entry to cite a distinctly authored and titled table in a particularly titled and edited volume of a specifically titled series that was accessed at a particularly titled Internet page?  <br/>
<br/>
Where should I enter my source of the source, which may or may not include the title of a published work?</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>AdrianB38</strong> 2011-03-18T14:05:46-07:00</div>
<div class="text">Gene - when you ask, "where are the fields in GEDCOM?" - they aren't there. As I'm sure you realise. When Louis says "Putting all info into one field is wrong", I agree with him but what I mean (and I imagine Louis means also) is that, if we could start from fresh, it's wrong. As it is, with GEDCOM, it's a case of choosing the least worst option. <br/>
<br/>
What we need to do with BetterGEDCOM is identify the elements to accommodate all those things that you mention. What's interesting is that we may find that these elements are as volatile as the list of events and just like we need to be able to react quickly to add extra events, so maybe we need to react quickly to add extra "citation / bibliography" elements as new types of document appear????<br/>
<br/>
I don't know on this volatility - just a personal thought.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally - re your question about italics. This is really something that gets me going. It's plain and simple a fault in using Chicago style for non-experts. It's absurd to expect the general population to understand that italics means X (and doesn't the page numbering change from comma to semi-colon or was that just a nightmare I had?) To me, the title of a published or unpublished work is a title and whether or not it's published should be indicated by the presence of publishing data. I note you have a 3rd option though, which is interesting - not sure how I'd like to code that yet.<br/>
<br/>
And your source of the source question is a good one - I'm not sure I've seen a full EE example of that sort of thing... Thank goodness ESM says citing is an art!</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>GeneJ</strong> 2011-03-18T22:03:50-07:00</div>

<br/>
Here's Elizabeth's response to the question, "What is important to remember about citing online sources vs. more traditional ones such as documents, newspapers, books, etc.?"<br/>
<br/>
Mills replies,"The most important point to remember is the sameness, not the difference. Whether we are citing a source from a physical place or a virtual place, we need to record two types of data:<br/>
<br/>
    * Details that enable us and others to understand the nature of the source and gauge its reliability.<br/>
<br/>
    * Details that enable us and others to find the source again.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, the fact that our source is online, rather than on paper or other material, does not change its basic nature. A deed book is a deed book. A tombstone is a tombstone. An article is an article. A published abstract is a published abstract. Therefore, the basic citation remains the same."<br/>
<br/>
"The main difference created by digital publication of a source is that we may have more “layers” to cite. ..."<br/>
<br/>
Psst. Thomas also asked for advice to those didn't record sources with they first jumped into the sandbox, and now have "regrets." He asks, "How does one start the process of adding source citations to years’ worth of genealogy data?"<br/>
<br/>
Mills responds, "Ah, Dear Thomas!  It’s not just many of us who have this problem, it’s virtually everybody! Think of all the poor souls who started genealogy 25 years ago, using software that had no citation capability at all. ..."<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps most importantly, to the question of technology and sources, Mills comments, "Five years, Thomas, is a blip. Let’s look at thirty.<br/>
<br/>
Technology came into genealogy as a tool, but it quickly became a teacher.  The dominant teacher. Folks of the 80s and early 90s, who set out on a family-tree-climbing adventure, bought software and followed its instructions. If Program XYZ carried no data-entry screens for use in identifying sources, then users ‘learned’ that sources did not matter.  ... The 90s saw great advances on The Evidence Front. By the end of that decade, virtually every software program ‘taught’ its users that genealogy was not just about looking up names and dates ... The 2000s then brought us The Data Explosion. We now have more online providers of historical materials than any of us will ever live long enough to explore. .... It is wondrous to see the robustness of the technology that makes this possible. But it’s frustrating to see the extent to which technology’s teaching role has regressed in this new forum ..."<br/>
