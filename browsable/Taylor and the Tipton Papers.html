 For many years, the only record suggesting Sophia Ewing, wife and widow of John Preston (d. 1819), was the daughter of Alexander [and Charlotte (Griffiths)] Ewing was was notice in a published letter and related<br />
footnote in the source, John Tipton and Glenn A. Blackburn, <em>The John Tipton Papers, Volume 1 1809-1827</em> (1942) 1: 607-608.<br />
<br />
The footnote read, &quot;Mrs. Preston and Lavina were daughters of Alexander Ewing. Sophia Charlotte Ewing married (1) Captain John Preston; (2) William N. Hood; (3) Smallwood Noel. Lavina married ... Genealogy of the<br />
Ewing Family, compiled by Mrs. Sam R. Taylor in Indiana Biography Series, 4:99-101.&quot;<br />

 Over many years, I made unsuccessful searches for Mrs. Sam R. Taylor's compilation, &quot;Genealogy of the Ewing Family.&quot; A couple years ago, an Indiana state archivist took the search on as a mission. What he found was provided with a cover letter stating, &quot;...information concerning the Ewing family from the Indiana Biography Series v. 14 pp. 99-101&quot; (note the different volume number). The materials I received were image copies of from film (3 pages each from positive and negative film) of what I would otherwise describe as a manuscript titled, &quot;Genealogy of the Ewing Family.&quot; Mostly typed, the document did include a few handwitten notations; it was signed Isabella H. Taylor and dated 22 Nov 1929, Fort Wayne.<br />
<br />
I created a citation for the manuscript copies I'd received, in part as below:<br />
<br />
Isabella H. Taylor (Fort Wayne, Indiana), &quot;Genealogy of the Ewing Family,&quot; 22 Nov 1929, 3 pp.; image copies from film ...; referenced as &quot;Indiana Biography Series 14: 99-101&quot;; Indiana State Library, Indianapolis, Indiana ... &quot;<br />

 With the assistance of Colleen Method, a genealogy friend and blogger from Indiana, I located a good reference showing Mrs. Samuel R. Taylor was Isabelle Houghton Taylor [possibly changed from Isabella Houghton Taylor].<br />

Other research about Taylor provided insight into why/how she might have written some of the details contained in the manuscript.<br />

 I have all these notations in my file. I feel confident the image copies from Indiana is the work referred to in <em>The John Tipton Papers</em>, but as you probably see, there are a different ways that reference might be reported in my file. You just don't know what tiny nuance might make a difference in locating a record.<br />
<br />
The Indiana Biography Series contains more than ninety volumes. Digital images of the card entries to Series are online (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.isl.lib.in.us/INBiopre1990/bio_cards_search.asp)--it's" rel="nofollow">http://web.isl.lib.in.us/INBiopre1990/bio_cards_search.asp)--it's</a> the same index where Ms. Taylor's reference was learned. I've yet to find the entry for her work on the Ewing family, though, so I couldn't tell you today whether the correct volume is 4 or 14.
