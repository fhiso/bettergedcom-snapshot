<div class="text">OOoO, and lookie here. The Family History Information Standards Organisation, FHISO, will be participating in RootsTech 2012. We hope those attending this important conference will join us in the featured presentations listed below:<br/>
<br/>
“Family History Information Standards Organisation (FHISO) – What It Is, and How to Get Involved”<br/>
<br/>
Presented by Robert Burkhead<br/>
Date: Friday, February 3, 2012<br/>
Time: 12:50 p.m.<br/>
Place: Room 258<br/>
<br/>
“Sources, Citations, Metadata” (panel discussion)<br/>
<br/>
Hosted by Ancestry Insider; Robert Burkhead (FHISO) and Louis Kessler (Behold) will be panelists<br/>
Date: Friday, February 3, 2012<br/>
Time: 4:15 p.m. (90 minutes)<br/>
Place: Room 257</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>WesleyJohnston</strong> 2012-02-09T17:29:12-08:00</div>
<div class="text">I have to share this idea that I had at RootsTech for a phone app. I had already been thinking that we could eventually have a conference badge that had a chip with our family tree and some way of broadcasting this, so that if someone else from the conference was nearby had one or more of the same people, we would both receive an alert.<br/>
<br/>
But during the Ancestry.com luncheon on Saturday, which was focused on mobile genealogy, it dawned on me that expanding the Ancestry phone app would actually be a better way of doing the same thing. So when the Q&amp;A began, I made this suggestion for an app. Clearly it is pushing the technology and would take some doing, but I think it is a doable app.<br/>
<br/>
So it would give me an option in the Ancestry app to broadcast my tree in the immediate area (may need GPS to deal with this), so that if someone else has similar checked that option in their app, then our trees would be compared and if any matches were found (just like Ancestry's leaf finds other potential family trees on Ancestry - so something they already do, though not within the limits of a cell phone's processor), then we would both receive an alert that would give each other the other's phone number and name and list the matching people ... and of course beep our cell phones with an audio alert.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>bamcphee</strong> 2012-03-03T01:49:55-08:00</div>
<div class="text">I have looked across BetterGEDCOM  Wiki and Blog and FHISO web and blog.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot locate a report of the presentation 'Family History Information Standards Organisation (FHISO) – What It Is, and How to Get Involved'.<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in reading how it went, the follow on results and other details.<br/>
<br/>
Could someone point me to the correct location please?</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>Andy_Hatchett</strong> 2011-11-28T13:35:28-08:00</div>
<div class="text">I would hope so. I had planned to attend but it doesn't look like that will be possible so I'll have to settle for whatever they put on the web like I did last year.<br/>
<br/>
I do wish the RootsTech website would show which events will be webcast in addition to the other info there.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>louiskessler</strong> 2011-11-28T17:34:42-08:00</div>
<div class="text">I wanted to present at RootsTech. I submitted to their Call for Presentations four proposals:<br/>
<br/>
1. GEDCOM - Past, Present and Future<br/>
<br/>
2. Organizing Your Source Material - On the Computer and Off<br/>
<br/>
3. Finding the Right Genealogy Software for You<br/>
<br/>
4. The Technological Demands of Today's Genealogy Software.<br/>
<br/>
I waited several months and finally got a form letter saying:<br/>
<br/>
<ul class="quotelist"><li>Thank you for your recent presentation proposal for RootsTech Conference</li><li>2012. Unfortunately, we must decline your proposal, based on its</li><li>relevance to the topic areas of the RootsTech Conference and the</li><li>overwhelming number of speaker applications.</li></ul><br/>
I inquired as to why they thought my four proposals were not very relevant for Roots Tech. <br/>
<br/>
They said: "I think part of reason is that your proposals came into the system as "See Above for the 4 Titles." Could you please email me the four session titles as we did not receive them."<br/>
<br/>
So I did send the original proposal in to them again. That was back in August. <br/>
<br/>
I never heard back from them. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone know why I got the discourtesy of not getting any reply, even a "no" reply back from them?  <br/>

<div class="text">I've never been to RootsTech but decided to go mainly because I would probably regret not going and always wonder what I would see there. Is it entirely a product of FamilySearch? And if so is there some bias involved that really is making the conference more for their benefit than for the general benefit? Is there a need for a conference of this type that is free of bias -- much as we BetterGEDCOM is seeking to become the standard bearer, independent of any organization or company?</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>WesleyJohnston</strong> 2011-12-01T00:34:35-08:00</div>
<div class="text">I see a real existential issue for BetterGEDCOM in the blurbs for Ryan Heaton's talks.<br/>
<br/>
There are two talks:<br/>
<br/>
1 - A New GEDCOM: Project Scope, Goals, and Governance<br/>
The GEDCOM standard is stale. What does a new GEDCOM initiative look like? What is its scope and goals? How is the project governed?<br/>
<br/>
2-A New GEDCOM: Tools, Syntax and Semantics<br/>
The GEDCOM standard is stale. What would a new GEDCOM look like in terms of its syntax and semantics? What tools would be made available to promote and apply it?<br/>
<br/>
If BetterGEDCOM is not the answer to his question "What does a new GEDCOM initiative look like?", this would be a major problem for BetterGEDCOM.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>Andy_Hatchett</strong> 2011-12-01T01:08:39-08:00</div>
<div class="text">As I can't attend RootsTech, I *really* hope these two talks are webcast.<br/>
<br/>
I'm most interested to see just what Family Search's ideas are.<br/>
<br/>
I seriously doubt that BetterGEDCOM will be extolled as *THE* answer to his questions, but it may be mentioned as one group working to provide answers to his questions.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>ttwetmore</strong> 2011-12-01T05:31:32-08:00</div>

<div class="text">I took a look at the RootsTech presentation schedule. If I were attending I believe the following are the ones I would try to attend:<br/>
<br/>
Software Forecast 2.0: What Genealogists Need for the Future At last year’s RootsTech conference “Software Forecast” presented a full list of software, plug-ins, and other tools needed for genealogists. How far have we come? Explore solutions developed over the past year, issues that remain unresolved, and a new set of needs for the future during this year’s software forecast.     Developer     D. Joshua Taylor<br/>

<br/>
Future of FamilySearch Family Tree With the changes occurring in FamilySearch, what is the future of new.familysearch.org (the family tree) and how will it fold into the FamilySearch website. How will the family tree be improved to allow users to correct data and make the site the most correct place of sourced genealogical conclusions? How will FamilySearch deal with the current issues around the family tree such as disputes, combining and separating, discussions, getting others to change the data, interacting with record managers and collaboration?

Citation Principles for Tech Creators Meeting the citation needs of genealogists goes beyond copying the templates from Elizabeth Shown Mills’s Evidence Explained. This session explains citation principles that technology creators can exploit to more fully meet their customers’ needs.     Developer     Robert Raymond<br/>

<br/>
A User’s Perspective: Developing a Universal Metadata Structure for Genealogical Content Providers With a complicated world of for-profit and non-profit content providers, the need for a universal metadata structure is overwhelmingly apparent. The need to produce content that interacts with genealogical databases, social networking resources, and mobile technologies is essential to maintaining relevancy within the genealogical marketplace. Come listen to one perspective on the need for such a structure and its necessary components.     User     D. Joshua Taylor<br/>

<div class="title">E&amp;C;</div>
<div class="text">We had a fair bit of discussion during the meeting about my opinion that the source reference needs to be separated from the citation and the citation templates.<br/>
<br/>
But one exhibit that GeneJ displayed during the meeting that impressed me the most was the Zotaro which had the source types across the top (artwork, audioRecording, blogPost, book, etc) and had the attributes down the left (accessDate,blogTitle, bookTitle, callNumber, date, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I think this is exactly what needs to be in BetterGEDCOM, but it must be the Source Types and Attributes needed for Genealogy, for Shown Mills, for Lackey, and for any other citation methods that might be used.<br/>
<br/>
But we can be smart about it. Attributes such as blogTitle and bookTitle can both be "Title", since the Source Type then infers what the title is about.<br/>
<br/>
Citation templates would then be simple. They would define how to order and format and punctuation the attributes for a source type, under different conditions.<br/>

<div class="title">RootsMagic v5 Webinar</div>
<div class="text">I attended this well presented Webinar tonight, "What's New in RootsMagic 5." There are a number of new features including the Research Manager, Timeline View, CountyCheck and  Media Tagging. <br/>
<br/>
These new features will be of interest to many BetterGEDCOM members. Of note, the changes impact how research tasks are recorded and accessed, how digital media is entered, accessed and tagged, how source detail research notes are entered (what we think of as the citation text field is now "Research Notes"*).<br/>
<br/>
Following the presentation, there was a poll to survey which of the new features users were most excited about. Research Manager was the highest rated, followed by Media Tagging, CountyCheck and Timeline view. <br/>
<br/>
I would imagine there will be many reviews and blog articles posted shortly covering the new features. Also, RootsMagic makes many of its webinars available for later viewing at the link below, so those who were not able to attend tonight's webinar may be later able to download a recording later. <br/>
