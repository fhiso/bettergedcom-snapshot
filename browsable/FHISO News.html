<br/>
<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">“As family historians embrace the digital age and new technology transforms the way we research, discover and collate information about our ancestors, it is vitally important that we ensure that we adhere to the highest standards available when accessing and sharing data online. We are already seeing some of the problems emerging - incorrect citation of primary sources, confusion about where information was originally created, and issues around referencing personal archives that have been made available on the internet. The Federation of Family History Societies is therefore proud to be one of the founder members of FHISO, and will assist its work in creating the much-needed standards for genealogical data around the world”, said Dr. Nick Barratt, FFHS President.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">"We are a community of diverse practitioners and interests.

Already instrumental in uniting more than 160 member societies in the United Kingdom and around the globe, FFHS brings vision and experience to FHISO. Our future is today better and brighter for their commitment", said acting FHISO Chairman, Robert Burkhead. </span></span><br/>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">“One of the things that distinguishes modern standards development is the diversity of interests that drive the multi-stakeholder model.

<strong><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 12pt;">WikiTree joins the growing list of FHISO Founding Members</span></strong><br/>
<br/>
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">Croton-on-Hudson, NY and Gilbert, AZ </span><span class="caps" style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">— August </span><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">15, 2012 — WikiTree.com and Family History Information Standards Organisation, Inc. (</span><span class="caps" style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">FHISO</span><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">) announced today that WikiTree has finalized its plans to become a founding member of the organization. As part of this process, WikiTree has designated its founder, Chris Whitten, as an organizational member representative. Chris will participate with other FHISO members from the global genealogical community in the development of standards for the digital representation and sharing of family history and genealogical information.</span></span><br/>
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">"Although the mission of the WikiTree community is to grow a worldwide family tree, only a fraction of the world's genealogical information will ever be organized and stored on WikiTree.com. The worldwide tree is something much larger and greater than any one forum or organization. That's what makes universal standards so important. Information on WikiTree needs to fluidly connect with information elsewhere. When the FHISO team invited WikiTree to join as a founding member, I jumped at the opportunity," said WikiTree founder, Chris Whitten.</span></span><br/>
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">"WikiTree is a dynamic, innovative platform where community members work together to connect our ancestral families. This sense of community spirit is also important to FHISO’s development. Today’s announcement represents the innovators of one community, WikiTree, supporting the development of another, FHISO. Our many thanks to Chris Whitten for helping FHISO connect with another important market sector,” said Robert Burkhead (USA), member of the FHISO organizing team.</span></span><br/>
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">WikiTree is a community of member volunteers collaborating to develop a single world tree. By design, WikiTree sets out to balance the interests of privacy and so that everyone can share the same family tree. This dynamic, innovative approach to family history began in 2008 and has been growing ever since. Members of the WikiTree community agree to an “Honor Code” in their joint work. Chris Whitten, WikiTree founder, has made a pledge to keep the platform free.

<strong><a name="Proctor Build BetterGEDCOM"></a>FHISO and BetterGEDCOM in the news</strong>. (2012-04-10)<br/>
<br/>
"If we’re to become better genealogists, then we need a better storage format.” So writes our own <a class="wiki_link" href="ACProctor">A. C. "Tony" Proctor</a> in “Building a BetterGEDCOM:<br/>
Building a Better World,” an article appearing in the current (April 2012) issue of <em>Your Family History</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Tony's article introduces FHISO and touches on many BetterGEDCOM discussion topics, including the need for a new format to be "flexible and<br/>
accommodating " toward the definition of the family unit. By golly, he managed to highlight both "E&amp;C" and Elizabeth Shown Mills in the same article!<br/>
<br/>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #404040; display: block; text-align: left;">(b) hands-on assistance to develop materials that seed an initial set of working groups and project teams. In support of same, some particular work with the BetterGEDCOM Requirements Catalog is needed.</span><br/>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #404040; display: block; text-align: left;">(c) website design and development,</span><br/>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #404040; display: block; text-align: left;">(e) graphic design/promotional materials suitable for independent presentation to vendors, family historians and genealogical organizations around the globe,</span><br/>

Does the use of the word 'exchanging' really mean only exchanging their stuff internally with some of their other stuff?<br/>
I think not.<br/>
<br/>
But it could be for exchanging internally and externally, from FamilySearch, with no thought of other programs, individuals or needs.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>GeneJ</strong> 2012-07-20T16:22:39-07:00</div>

Wonderful. I was just googling trying to find such a succinct definition. In the telecommunications world this used to be an illegal practice. When I worked at Bell Labs for AT&amp;T, Network Systems, and Lucent, every public statement we made about our products and plans had to be vetted by our lawyers looking for breaches in this practice. Much of Microsoft's wealth is based on their constant use of this practice. However, in this day and age no one even worries about it anymore. We all promise the world and rarely deliver.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>GeneJ</strong> 2012-07-20T20:07:15-07:00</div>

<div class="text">BTW, I'm very happy to see competition for the best standard. Can we try and compare Tom's and Louis' and Tony's ideas with GEDCOM X somehow? <br/>
<br/>
I think GEDCOM X is developed a bit backwards: first they code, then they put it into diagrams and maybe then into plain language. Requirements aren't formulated in detail. This leads to a lot of trial and error and reworking, but still, things get done. <br/>
<br/>
BetterGEDCOM does it in a more traditional way: first a lot of brainstorming, then setting down the requirements, then discussing each of them. And there we are, a bit stuck, I feel. <br/>
We have a few models to look at and discuss, but we are not working much on _the_ BG model.<br/>
Github is a good tool for developing code, maybe we could use it with plain text to develop a "unified" standard with the best ideas of every model? What are the best ideas of each model? (If anyone wants to answer that, I guess a new thread is in order...)</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>GeneJ</strong> 2012-07-20T14:23:51-07:00</div>

<br/>
Have you considered that is only seems that way? In other words, does it seem that Ryan works from code to plain language because that is the way it is they are exposing it? <br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, most of the standards materials and work goes on behind the closed door. Do we know which developers had the early hand in developing the requirements? Maybe Tom knows?</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>ACProctor</strong> 2012-07-20T14:43:01-07:00</div>
<div class="text">Easily the biggest of all my personal issues with GEDCOM-X is that it is unusable for representing my own data [I do hope FamilySearch are reading this]. It may be capable of representing FamilySearch's data, but the model is incapable of representing my data.<br/>
<br/>
If I were a commercial organisation then I would have to "address" GEDCOM-X in one of my releases, otherwise it would be commercial suicide, but I could not embrace its data model internally. I would have to continue using my proprietary one (STEMMA in my case).<br/>
<br/>
So, will the industry be any better off by virtue of GEDCOM-X? No!   Data sharing will be just as messed up as before.<br/>
<br/>
Only a community standard can reduce the industry fragmentation, and consolidate our requirements.<br/>

<br/>
A reasonable question, Gene - but I've actually read Ryan (I think it was him) being quite open that they were coding FIRST and then coming up with the supporting designs, etc. And it seemed that the reason (the only reason?) that they were coming up with the supporting designs was to enable the outside world to comment on what they had produced. Which is an eminently sensible thing to want to do, of course, but it puts the rest of us in catch-up mode, only able to comment on the bits that they've got round to back-translating. <br/>

"Right now, everything at GEDCOM X is out in the open."<br/>
<br/>
Hardly! Everything that FS wants made public about GEDCOM X is out in the open but...<br/>
<br/>
The actual decisions, exactly how and why they are made, and exactly who makes them is *not* public.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is that no matter how accommodating Ryan, Troy, and the others are  about accepting suggestions ( and both Ryan and Troy have been *very accomodating), the fact is that it is ONLY FS personnel that can actually make concrete decisions about what goes into or is left out of GEDCOM X.<br/>
<br/>
Why anyone would support anything from anybody when they do not have an actual role in the decision making process concerning that thing is completely  beyond me.<br/>

<div class="text">Gene asked: "Where do these [Mon-and-Pop] applications fall in terms of GEDCOM X? I thought GEDCOM X was supposed to replace GEDCOM?"<br/>
<br/>
This is the interesting bit for me. FS may well be the x-hundred pound gorilla in the room, but if no-one else picks up GEDCOMX, then it's as dead as GEDCOM 6 was. And BetterGEDCOM is. And why _should_ these guys pick up G-X? The last time I tried to find my way round the models, they didn't offer much that was new in _genealogical_ terms to anyone adopting them, so where's the incentive to embark on a huge investment? I really hope there's a good reason for them to go forward, but at the moment I feel like this is an eternal triangle of end-users wanting change, IT geeks like ourselves creating proposals and software suppliers. We need all three, and one lot aren't actually - so far as I can see - committing because there's no good reason for them to do so. If this sounds cynical, I'm sorry - it's actually meant to be realistic. I've made major changes to systems in my time, but I've always had good reason to do so. I'm still waiting for the killer-reason to get the software suppliers on board.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>ttwetmore</strong> 2012-07-20T15:09:40-07:00</div>
<div class="text">@GeneJ, Responding to your request for GEDCOM-X insight:<br/>
<br/>
I'm obviously not an authority on the deeper goals of GEDCOM-X, but I can summarize my between the lines opinions. Whether I truly have any insights I will leave to your judgement.<br/>
<br/>
I do not believe that GEDCOM-X is consciously targeting the exchange of data between the ecosystem formed by the desktop genealogical applications. I have the impression that GEDCOM-X is dedicated to two different <em>internal</em> applications.<br/>
<br/>
1. Application one -- Managing their on-line trees with their own data and with data provided by users. For this they are designing the GEDCOM-X Conclusion Model. That model features two main object types, the Person and the Relationship. There is no Family object, places are not first class objects. The only Relationships of interest are parent/child and spouse/spouse. They have another model, the Source Metadata Model for holding source information that the conclusion objects may refer to.<br/>
<br/>
2. Application two -- Managing the digitization of their massive collection of record data. The LDS is going through two evolutions, first from their master catalog of microfilms, thence to digital images taken from the microfilms, and thence to digital text indexes and fuller extractions taken the digital images. The GEDCOM-X Record Model is being designed to be the digital text format for the ultimate extracted records, replacing what used to be called SORD. The Record Model also uses the Source Metadata Model for holding its source information.<br/>
<br/>
Presumably the Conclusion Model could be a replacement for GEDCOM, though without a Family record there might be great objection.<br/>
<br/>
To fully support the research process I have argued on the GEDCOM-X issues list, that the two models should be combined, which can lead to the multi-level persona/person model I have always advocated (and that many object to).</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>GeneJ</strong> 2012-07-20T15:21:18-07:00</div>

And again I ask "what this reply has to do with having five Ancestry.com representatives with FHSIO".<br/>
<br/>
I understand Ancestry's position and internal best option, but having 5 representatives a majority does not make. Looking at the structure of FHISO, (which I may add appears unmanageable to fill all the roles, given the minimal input by all across genealogy), if there are 5 other companies, each with 5 reps, and who knows how many individuals, they will be a small voice in the standard setting proces.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>Andy_Hatchett</strong> 2012-07-20T16:04:46-07:00</div>

<div class="text">Andy asks why on earth I would think that having five Ancestry.com representatives with FHSIO might be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
To anyone who has spent many years in the technical world, and been involved with the development of major real world standards, the answer is fairly obvious. Ancestry.com and FamilySearch are the big gorillas. They each have their own internal data standards, and they will not change them (it would cost them zillions of dollars to do so) for any new standard that is not based on their own internal formats and internal needs. Just think Microsoft. Microsoft played lip service to standards for decades but always turned around and did exactly what they wanted to. They would put new extensions onto fully agreed upon standards, or simply write their own, and because they were so big, if you wanted to play, you had to do it there way. Exactly the same can be said about FamilySearch and Ancestry.com.<br/>
<br/>
I am surprised that FHISO had the naiveté to entertain the idea that FamilySearch would open up their standards to the community. Anyone who knows about the hierarchy of the LDS should have known that the elders would not allow such a thing. Any hint of ceding control to an outside organization is impossible. But what is actually very encouraging about the current GEDCOM-X process is that FamilySearch has opened up their issue tracking system, which is proving to hold a number of great conversations about genealogical data models, and that Family Search is taking those conversations seriously. A number of outsiders, myself included, have raised issues and made suggestions that have been taken to heart and have caused changes. Many of the conversations have echoed the same conversations that used to occur on B-GEDCOM, but on the GEDCOM-X side there is an organization and an authority that can make the final decisions on topics and move on to others.<br/>
<br/>
With GEDCOM-X on the horizon, and with B-GEDCOM on the ropes, can FHISO be relevant? If GEDCOM-X proves sufficient to solve most of the problems of sharing data that are inherent with original GEDCOM, then it's not at all clear, is it?</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>Alex-Anders</strong> 2012-07-19T16:51:45-07:00</div>

<div class="text">@Alex says, "I have no idea what this reply has to do with having five Ancestry.com representatives with FHSIO"<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for being obtuse. Ancestry.com will come to any standards effort with vested interests, and they will either not agree to any standards that do not meet those interests, or they will ignore any standards that do not meet them, and simply continue with their business as usual. This is the nature of the standards beast. My allusion to Microsoft was intended to underscore the point. It should be intuitively obvious that Ancestry.com has no financial incentive for supporting a new genealogical standard, and great financial disadvantage for having to adopt new standards. It seems it must be up to me to once again to take on the bad boy role and point out these politically inconvenient facts.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you need to have been involved with standards efforts that involve large organizations to appreciate this. Standards bodies are among the most politically and selfishly motivated bodies that there are, with many hidden agendas coming from the participants. I worked in the telecommunications world for over 20 years, most of that time at Bell Labs, and I was involved with many standards activities with the giants of the telecomm industry. We're talking serious standards here, with committees flying to Geneva to meet with their international partners, etc, etc. Not sure where the allusions to "ethics" and "best efforts" come from. Participants often become the best of personal friends, go out boozing together in the evenings, but are cutthroat proponents for their own companies by day.<br/>
<br/>
I believe FHSIO should start by concentrating on the world of genealogical desktop applications, in the world of Mom-and-Pops, where there truly is some financial incentive to form a new standard, and try to extend GEDCOM in such a way that it is possible to foster better sharing between those apps. This was the problem that B-GEDCOM started out to solve. If B-GEDCOM then becomes a well established <em>lingua franca</em> then the larger organizations will be much more inclined to provide their support. Until then B-GEDCOM and FHSIO are akin to bothersome gnats to the giants.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I continue to bug all the non-tekkies on this list. I don't wish to make anyone angry, but there is a layer of technical knowledge and realism that is simply missing from the B-GEDCOM and FHSIO discussions.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>testuser42</strong> 2012-07-20T11:33:23-07:00</div>
<div class="text">My opinions on GEDCOM X: <br/>
<br/>
I try to keep up with the discussions on the issues at Github. <br/>
I am impressed with how many good people are contributing, how many good ideas there are, and how open Ryan is. He really gives the impression that he wants the best possible result, and not one that only suits FamilySearch internally. He (and others) have changed big parts of their initial code when others pointed out better ways. I hope he has the full backing of the FamilySearch organization. <br/>
<br/>
GEDCOM X already has people from outside the US participating, and they are getting heard. Also, it looks as if a big part (maybe half?) of active people are from outside the LDS or FS. And it also looks as if all of them are also active as genealogists.<br/>
<br/>
It's true that there are no people taking part who are "only users". The way that GEDCOM X is developed is making it hard for people (like me) who are not programmers but still could contribute if the models wouldn't be very deeply hidden in code, or the first test files unreadable for humans... But even there, I'm hopeful: it looks as if the exchange files will be a lot better readable in the next version. And maybe then some of the other "users-but-technically-inclined" can contribute a bit as well. <br/>
<br/>
But even now, I'm optimistic that GEDCOM X has a good chance, because of the good and open discussions there, with smart people who have their own ideas but are also willing to compromise.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>ttwetmore</strong> 2012-07-20T11:57:35-07:00</div>
<div class="text">@testuser42, I agree with you completely about GEDCOM-X. They are doing a great job of incorporating input from outside FS and they are seriously using that input.<br/>
<br/>
You can look at their models without having to dive down into code. Frankly, I completely shy away from looking at their code as it does not reflect the latest thinking. If you wander around on their web site long enough you will come across some model diagrams and some documentation that describes the components.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>GeneJ</strong> 2012-07-20T12:15:10-07:00</div>

Where do these applications fall in terms of GEDCOM X? I though GEDCOM X was supposed to replace GEDCOM? <br/>
<br/>
Any insight you can provide would be appreciated.--GeneJ</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>GeneJ</strong> 2012-07-20T13:12:55-07:00</div>

<div class="text">About GEDCOM X and FS not working together with FHISO:<br/>
<br/>
Right now, everything at GEDCOM X is out in the open. It's all in the Github project, and anyone can download it, make changes, upload again. It is also allowed to take the stuff from there and build something else from it (i.e. "fork" it). <br/>
I haven't seen a specific license yet. Is there one? If it's some GPL or similar open license, or CC, that would be amazing.<br/>
<br/>
So could FHISO take a fork of GEDCOM X if it wanted to make it an independent standard?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, FS is the 900 pound gorilla, and if they wanted to go closed-source again and announce their own thing then they could do it. And then there would be competing flavors of the same standard. But I don't see why FS would want to do something like that, it makes no sense. FS seem to be interested in developing a standard that is good for them and for their customers. If they wanted something that's only useful for them, then they would only work on the separate "record model".</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>ttwetmore</strong> 2012-07-19T10:29:11-07:00</div>
<div class="text">Louis, Thanks for posting the link. Interesting article and interesting responses. GEDCOM-X is very active, and anyone can follow and comment on their issues. GEDCOM-X is a FamilySearch product, so they have full control over its definition, but they are actively engaging outsiders for comments and have been taking those comments seriously enough to make a number of changes.<br/>
<br/>
B-GEDCOM seems kaput. There are a few postings now and again, but nothing serious is being done. I would say that B-GEDCOM is in a holding pattern awaiting FHISO to reach critical mass. It was fascinating to read the criticisms levied at B-GEDCOM because developers are involved! The users were responsible for a long and excellent list of B-GEDCOM requirements. Once requirements exist one would hope that developers would be involved to design to those requirements. It seems that you and I must apologize because we are developers who takes the requirements seriously and are helping to design a model that meets them! One must wonder how many more ways B-GEDCOM will find to shoot itself in the foot!<br/>
<br/>
FHISO remains a mystery to me. I have no idea what it will be able to do. With FamilySearch coming out with a new GEDCOM I would expect that FHISO is struggling to find a raison d'être. With five members from Ancestry.com, I would think that nothing that is not fully endorsed and already decided by Ancestry.com could come from FHISO. FHISO may end up taking fait accompli standards like GEDCOM-X and promulgating them as officially endorsed FHISO standards. There is much precedence for this in the standards world, and it would probably be a good model for them to work under.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>Andy_Hatchett</strong> 2012-07-19T13:56:55-07:00</div>
<div class="text">Tom, you said:<br/>
"With five members from Ancestry.com, I would think that nothing that is not fully endorsed and already decided by Ancestry.com could come from FHISO."<br/>
<br/>
Why on earth would you think that? The final standards published by FHISO will be approved by member wide balloting. I can't see how 5 votes out of the total membership could play a determining role in the outcome of any vote on that standard.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>AdrianB38</strong> 2012-07-19T14:39:16-07:00</div>
<div class="text">Andy - doesn't that depend on how many members there are?<br/>

<div class="text">Hi Adrian,<br/>
<br/>
There are guidelines that provide a framework in which community standards organizations may operate. While there are probably better terms, I'll suggest key words "ethics" and "best outcomes." <br/>
<br/>
Among these is "lack of dominance"; another, is "balance of interests."<br/>
<br/>
Given this ethics and best outcomes frame work, and what we already know about the interest expressed in FHISO, I'm comfortable with Andy's reaction. --GeneJ</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>hrworth</strong> 2012-07-19T15:29:20-07:00</div>

<br/>
I am guessing that this comment "It was fascinating to read the criticisms levied at B-GEDCOM because developers are involved!" was directed at me. It is / was wonderful to have developers involved from the get-go. However, YOU, TOM, didn't want to hear from End Users. I pulled completely away from this project because of many of YOUR comments.<br/>
<br/>
I am only sorry that, it appears, that you took the developers involvement as being negative. That was NOT my intent, is that is what you were referring to.<br/>
