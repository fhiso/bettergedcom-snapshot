 Notes by GeneJ<br />
<br />
Meeting was conducted in the BetterGEDCOM Organizers Meeting chat room. By prior notice, Myrt was not in attendance (attending Salt Lake Institute of Genealogy). <br />
<br />
Louis Kessler and GeneJ Composer were present. <br />
Meeting opened at about 4:00 (PST); meeting ended at about 4:30 (PST).<br />
<br />
Topics Discussed:<br />
1. Wiki activity: <br />
Good discussions this week on the wiki. Highlighted benefits of the spread sheet for BetterGEDCOM comparisons.<br />
Observation that even when we don't agree, our postings to the discussions influence each others insight and opinion.<br />
Observation that many of us do come from different perspectives. <br />
<br />
2. Wiki questions:<br />
GeneJ commented that she'd like to see another spread sheet started to support discussion of sources/citations/evidence.<br />
Highlighted need for definition of terms &quot;citation&quot; and &quot;evidence&quot; in the spirit of BetterGEDCOM. <br />
<br />
3. Brief source discussion<br />
(a) Elizabeth Shown Mills' styled templates (ala, quicksheets). Nightmarish from a data standpoint.<br />
-not all programs necessarily advance the identical templates and may advance different definitions for commonly named templates.<br />
-not all programs necessarily even advance the templates<br />
-Template styles are subject to revision. So that even within a given program, what is there &quot;XXX&quot; template today might not look the same or be called the same thing at the next program update.<br />
(b) Observation that users will want BetterGEDCOM robust enough to process the source information recorded in Mills style, including processing that data at the element level. <br />
(c) Observation that advancing the elements will not be a small task; perhaps identify key elements and allow for custom elements.<br />

Note: Bear logged the meeting, but failed to download the log prior to midnight. Additions and corrections to the above notes are welcome.
