During the 27th December 2010 BetterGEDCOM Organizers' Meeting, the group requested a <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=tpPvakrLEAbgabaFzTk8wZw&amp;hl=en#" rel="nofollow">sharable Google Doc &quot;comparison worksheet&quot;</a> so that data models can be compared side by side in preparation for our Large Group Meeting, scheduled for 3 January 2011.<br />
<br />
If you'd like to be added to the &quot;shared list&quot; so you can view the worksheet, do let <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="mailto:bettergedcom@gmail.com" rel="nofollow">us</a> know.<br />
<br />
From my experiments, placing a copy of the document here works only when the worksheet is complete.<br />
<br />
Since it is possible the Comparison Worksheet will be edited over time, it isn't practical to publish a copy of the worksheet here. (See: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=55244" rel="nofollow">http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=55244</a><strong>)</strong><br />
