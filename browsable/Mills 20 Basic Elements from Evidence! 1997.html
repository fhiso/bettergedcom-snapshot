<strong>Elizabeth Shown Mills, _Evidence!: Citations &amp; Analysis for the family historian</strong>_ (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing, 1997), p. 62, &quot;Record sources are endlessly varied. Yet all citations are constructed from a few basic elements.&quot; There followed a table recognizing about 20 basic elements and seven &quot;main types of resources genealogists use.&quot; The table design indicated which of the elements were &quot;almost always&quot; or &quot;sometimes&quot; applicable to each of the seven types of resources.<br />
<br />
The seven &quot;main types&quot; of resources therein are: <strong>Archival Manuscripts Articles, Books, Censuses, Electronic Data, Local Government Records. Microform</strong>.<br />

(which is the only one of her books I have), the table on &quot;Basic patterns of citation&quot; includes 20 elements that may, or may not, go to make up a citation. Now, you can argue about whether it should be 20 or a similar number, but that's not the point. â€¦ &quot;<br />
