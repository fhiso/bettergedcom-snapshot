<div class="title">PROPOSAL: Underlying Syntax</div>
<div class="text"><a class="wiki_link" href="/Better+GEDCOM+Requirements+Catalog#Syntax01">Underlying syntax</a><br/>
<br/>
I propose BetterGedcom use XML as its syntax.<br/>
<br/>
Pros:<br/>
<ul><li>Well supported by development tools</li><li>Schema validation</li><li>Namespaces</li><li>Well supported by virtually all programming languages</li></ul><br/>
Cons:<br/>
<ul><li>Verbose</li></ul></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>gthorud</strong> 2011-04-20T17:53:09-07:00</div>
<div class="text">There have been long discussions about using XML for BG. The conclusion so far is that this is nothing that has to be decided now. I personaly have not seen any better alternative, but the syntax for BG is not realy an E&amp;C issue.<br/>
<br/>
I think the descussions so far has shown that Gedcom works well as a "working value syntax" for presentation of examples because most of us is familiar with it, and there is not so much noice as in XML - it is easier to read. I am not aware of any data structure that we will have that can be presented in XML, but not in Gedcom, but there could be ??? <br/>
<br/>
But as a "type" syntax, I am not sure what is best, the "BNF" of Gedcom or a DTD. With a DTD, you can still use Gedcom as value syntax, perhaps with a convention for XML attributes. We have also managed well with simple quasi syntaxes - as the one I presented for Extractions.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>AdrianB38</strong> 2011-04-21T03:44:44-07:00</div>

<br/>
for any discussion that might arise on this topic - can we agree to use that topic, please, then we can have all (fairly specific) discussions on requirements and possible solutions in one area?<br/>
<br/>
I would, by the way, be quite happy with XML as a choice</div></div></div></body>
