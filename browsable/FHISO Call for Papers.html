On March 22nd, 2013, FHISO launched a <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://fhisohttp//fhiso.org/call-for-papers/.org/call-for-papers/" rel="nofollow">Call-for-Papers</a> initiative.<br />
<br />
The most pressing requirement is currently a standard Data Model for the ‘exchange and long-term storage of genealogical and family history data’. Proposals for this may be of a technical nature, directly contributing to the design, or functional requirements that must be met by any subsequent design. However, even technical proposals must be accompanied by use-cases to illustrate their value and applicability.<br />
<br />
Beyond this Data Model standard, FHISO will be involved in all data standards related to genealogy and family history. Another proposal type is, therefore, one identifying a further area needing standardisation.<br />
<br />
The following broad proposal types may be submitted:<br />
<ul><li>Technical proposal. A description of design elements to be included in the Data Model standard. It should include use-cases to justify the requirement.</li><li>Functional Requirements. A description of a requirement that must be supported by the Data Model standard. This might be related to global or cultural variations, historical differences, existing software functionality, etc.</li><li>An area requiring standardisation. Most contributions will likely be towards the Data Model standard but we also need to look ahead to other areas that may require their own, distinct standards.</li></ul><br />
The aforementioned link provides some real examples of proposals already submitted.<br />
<br />
All proposals will be made publicly readable, and members may submit comments on proposals that they believe will enhance the later design process.<br />
<br />
FHISO would like to emphasise that this isn't just soliciting technical papers. FHISO also require functional requirements and use-cases that must be supported by the standards, and especially ones that apply worldwide.
