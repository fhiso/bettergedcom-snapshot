<div class="title">Family Fie for BetterGEDCOM</div>
<div class="text">Russ has been doing a lot of work to test current GEDCOM transfers between existing programs. There are a few threads about that here.<br/>
<br/>
We are using third party files right now. My guess is we don't know these files well enough to be assured they include the array of family circumstance and evidence and conclusion level information we may want for our BetterGEDCOM effort.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts? --GJ</div></div></body>
