 This component of a citation is sometimes referred to as a &quot;reference&quot; or &quot;credit line.&quot; Mills has a nice discussion about the &quot;source of the source&quot; in Evidence Explained (2007) p. 52. She writes, &quot;When other authors identify their source for a detail that is relevant to us, we should add to our note a statement such as ..&quot;; she continues with the example below:<br />
The author cites “Register 3, page 235, St. Peter’s Parish, Wilmington, Delaware.”<br />
<br />
Mills continues, &quot;Credit should always be given where it is due. By the same token, we would not wish to assume the blame for an error another writer made in using a record we have not seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
I enter reference/source of the source/credit lines where it is relevant--sometimes in the Master Source level, sometimes at the assertion level. This is another component that might be entered at both levels.
