&quot;Needed changes that would cause major compatibilities with prior implementations were postponed until release 6.0, some time in the future. Minor 5.x releases may occur in the interim.&quot; This tells me that even by the release of the 5.5 standard, FamilySearch recognized the existing GEDCOM standard's syntax caused limitations that could not be fixed within its framework.<br />

The specification describes the standard at a low level in Chapter 1 and a high level in Chapter 2. The lower level is called the <em>GEDCOM data format,</em> and the high level is called a GEDCOM form (there can be many <em>GEDCOM forms</em>). The GEDCOM form for the purposes of the standard is specified as the <em>Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form</em>.<br />

This table should be useful in seeing how these sections correspond with our future efforts.<br />

As illustrated by this table, BetterGEDCOM (BG) will benefit from using the existing XML data format by not having to define a custom low-level data syntax.<br />
