 <br />
Background--During the <span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><a class="wiki_link" href="19Sep2011DevelopersMeetingNotes" target="_blank">19 Sept 2011 Developers Meeting</a></span>, Gordon Clarke discussed the potential to develop a community-owned organization that would become the focus of technology standardization for the international genealogical community. Mr. Clarke subsequently posted various helpful materials to the page, &quot;<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><a class="wiki_link" href="Developing+the+Organization">Developing the Organization</a></span>,&quot; including a set of eight (8) instruction points.<br />
In the <span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><a class="wiki_link" href="24October2011DevelopersMeetingNotes" target="_blank">24 Oct 2011 Developers Meeting</a></span>, an ad hoc committee (herein, &quot;the committee&quot;) was created to collaborate about &quot;Developing the Organization&quot; (aka &quot;DTO&quot;). Specifically, this committee will work to expedite an initial proposal for further comment by the BetterGEDCOM membership. The committee plans to work mostly in a restricted GoogleGroup to develop an initial proposal for BetterGEDCOM. This wiki page, &quot;DTO Forward Looking Draft,&quot; provides an preliminary organization framework about which members can dialog toward a more comprehensive proposal. Members of the Wiki should feel free to initiate discussions about this material (click the &quot;Discussions&quot; tab). Members who are interested in joining with ad hoc committee and participating in the GoogleGroups process should send a Wikispaces mail message to either GeneJ or Andy_Hatchett.<br />

<br />
The &quot;job&quot; of the organization structure is to develop and manage the resources by which international &quot;user requirements&quot; are learned and become translated into high quality, market-driven technical solutions through a consensus building process.<br />
<br />
<em>Membership Committee (aka MC)</em>--works to assure a balanced and active membership; develops, maintains and administers the membership rolls. See <a class="wiki_link" href="DTO%20Forward%20Looking.html#A-B">addendum B</a>, Membership Committee Proposal, including that <span style="color: #c00202;">the Membership Committee is intended to have the greatest influence over the organization's RULES in the same way that the Technical Committee influences the organization's PROCESSES.</span><br />
Discussion = The committee proposal should be develop in <a class="wiki_link" href="DTO%20Forward%20Looking.html#A-B">addendum B</a> and then summarized here. Initial concepts might be: (a) all members of the organization may be a part of the Membership Committee; (b) develops/oversees implementation of the organization Code of Conduct; (b) conducts outreach and communicates with members to develop and maintain a balanced active membership capable of supporting the needs of the organization; (c) maintains lists of current committee and project assignments/roles for all formal organization committees and projects, and such other documentation as necessary to tabulate voting/consensus on all circulars; (d) the Committee may be comprised of a number of membership working groups or sub-projects, but particular progress/action requires consensus among committee members--yet other progress requires consensus among all members of the community; (e) maintains the wiki HOME page, develops material for the Blog, and monitors the non-technical parts of the Wiki; (f) assures the operations of the organization remain open and transparent.* ...<br />
<br />
<em>Technical Committee (aka TC)--</em>responsible for establishing and administering standards/specification projects (Technical Projects), appoints Project Coordinators and determining the initial composition of Technical Project Committees (TPC).

<br />
<em>Steering Committee</em> - Responsible for developing/refining any organizational &quot;strategic plan&quot; and assures the organization is properly funded/sponsored. The Steering Committee also resolves disputes that may arise between the organizations' other standing committees. The Steering Committee is made up of nine (9) members--three Active Members from the Technical Committee (TCR), three Active Members of the Management Committee (MCR), and three expert members jointly and unanimously selected by the six TCR/MCR members. Members of the Steering Committee are defacto members of any of the organizations' standing committees or project teams; they may comment on any process at any time.<br />
<br />
Each committee or working group will include members acting in the roles of (1) coordinator ... to be described ... and (2) recorder ... to be described. Committees may assign other roles as necessary.<br />
<br />
Role of the Coordinator-<br />
<br />
Role of the Recorder-<br />

Benefits of Standardization - Standards <span style="color: #cf0202;">support innovation</span> and help ensure quality, reliability and the <span style="color: #d60000;">exchange of genealogical data</span> ...<br />
<br />
The following information was extracted from the wiki page, &quot;DTO Starting Summary,&quot; but needs to be improved upon by the ad hoc committee.<br />
<br />
The existing genealogical data model standard (GEDCOM) is outdated. The lack of a current standard stifles innovation and leads to noticeable loss or corruption in the process of data exchange/sharing. See also the BetterGEDCOM wiki pages, &quot;What's wrong with GEDCOM&quot; (<a class="wiki_link" href="Shortcomings+Of+GEDCOM">Shortcomings+Of+GEDCOM</a>) and &quot;BetterGEDCOM Requirements Catalog&quot; (<a class="wiki_link" href="Better+GEDCOM+Requirements+Catalog">Better+GEDCOM+Requirements+Catalog</a> ).<br />
<br />
Other Organizations--A group of 21 German-speaking developers have been working to agree on standardizing the usage of GEDCOM 5.5.1 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="message/view/home/29434177%2331192319" rel="nofollow">message/view/home/29434177#31192319</a>)<br />
At least since RootsTech 2011, there have been various discussions in the group about the work FamilySearch is doing on newGEDCOM / new gedccom. See the RootsTech 2012 schedule for a planned presentation (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://rootstech.org/schedule" rel="nofollow">http://rootstech.org/schedule</a> )<br />
SourceTemplates.org (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://sourcetemplates.org/" rel="nofollow">http://sourcetemplates.org/</a> ), with whom BetterGEDCOM is collaborating is working to standardizing particular source templates used in some software packages.<br />
There are various more independent or region-specific genealogical data models that have been or are in process.<br />
<br />
Associated groups and standards—“We” are truly not alone in this increasingly digitally connected world—&quot;we&quot; do not control the ‘net, nor do we control oversight of the vast majority of research and cultural heritage resources around the world. (Though one supposes we can dream.)<br />
<br />
Trends—(a) An increasingly globally connected world places more demands on collaborating and sharing genealogy/family history data. (b) Moving “to the cloud” demands flexibility about what, where and with whom they share information—it also brings up important user preferences about privacy. More and more, the user doesn’t ask which one software program will I use—but how many different software programs and platforms want to access. (c) Increasing trends in digitization (and standardization of same) means a remarkable quantity and quality of source materials are available. (d) And then we have more and more tablet and mobile users. Lets not forget cross platform, either. (e) Finally, expanding educational opportunities allow genealogists and family historians access to more scholarly techniques and methodologies.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>6. In the sixth section, detail the scope of the organization's</em></strong> <strong><em>activities. What will the organization do, make, sell, sing, etc.? Also,</em></strong> <strong><em>it is important to specify what is out of scope for the organization. This</em></strong> <strong><em>will help keep the organization appropriately focused in the years ahead.</em></strong><br />
<br />
The organization is responsible for developing and maintaining technology standards (see item 7); it provides various <span style="color: #d40202;">forums for input</span> to the development process and actively engages in <span style="color: #c40303;">consensus building on a committee and community-wide basis</span>. ... develops materials/input to support <span style="color: #f00000;">other standards setting development</span> processes.<br />

 <br />
General Processes and procedures.<br />
(1) Ideas/proposals developed by working teams become recognized when<span style="color: #c00202;"> written proposals</span> receive <span style="color: #c00202;">sponsorship</span> by one of the standing committees. Sponsorship generally requires commitment by <span style="color: #cf0202;">sufficient members (number and diversity) to work on the project/sub-project proposal and to see projects through conclusion</span>. Each team solicits input and develops more detailed <span style="color: #c00202;">proposals that are circulated in an orderly manner</span>. These circulars <span style="color: #c00202;">allow/require both comment and voting</span> in a <span style="color: #cf0202;">consensus building process</span>. Feedback from the circulars is used to <span style="color: #cf0202;">refine the work</span>; proposals continue to be circulated <span style="color: #cf0202;">until consensus is reach</span>. Circulars and consensus building occur first within the working group or committee, then among all the organizations' committees and finally with the community at large. <span style="color: #cf0202;">At each stage, the stakeholder/audience becomes generally larger/more completely represented</span>. See broadly, &quot;Schematic representation of ISO deliverables,&quot; especially for the concept of &quot;expert consensus building.&quot;<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/processes_and_procedures/deliverables/deliverables_schema-2.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/processes_and_procedures/deliverables/deliverables_schema-2.htm</a><br />
<br />
(2) <span style="color: #cf0202;">Market-Driven Development</span>. Proposals for development are considered by identifying user requirements/functionality seeking technology solutions. (Rather than the other way around.)<br />
<br />
(3) <span style="color: #cf0202;">Consensus building is a formal part of the process; circulars and draft standards require comment and voting</span>.<br />
Discussion = Simply making decisions and advancing projects does not build consensus. Conversely, commenting randomly or about matters often ancillary to the proposal at hand also does not build consensus. Some circulars may require commenting only when negative votes are cast; others may require comment regardless of whether the vote is favorable or not--these are among the &quot;rules&quot; that need to be quantified.<br />
<br />
(4) Members have a <span style="color: #cf0202;">duty to participate in the consensus building process</span> to retain an active status.<br />
<br />
(5) Members (technical and non-technical) who agree to work on a Project Committee (Technical Project Committee or Management Project Committee) are Project Members, see especially, addendums <a class="wiki_link" href="DTO%20Forward%20Looking.html#A-B">B</a> and <a class="wiki_link" href="DTO%20Forward%20Looking.html#A-C">C</a> (Membership Committee Proposal and Technical Committee Proposal).<br />

<h2 id="toc9"><a name="Discussion points for an organizational framework-Addendum B. Membership Committee Proposal"></a><a name="A-B"></a>Addendum B. Membership Committee Proposal</h2>
 <br />
One or more members of the ad-hoc committee should further develop the Membership Committee Proposal. It might include features as below....<br />
<br />
The Membership Committee works to assure a balanced and active Community Membership, and it develops, maintains and administers the membership rolls. All Active Members of the organization may participate in the business of the Membership Committee. One member of the Membership Committee is appointed as the Coordinator and another member acts as the Recorder. Three members of the membership committee are also members of the Steering Committee. These appointments are made by XXXX. Conceptually, the &quot;Membership Committee&quot; has the greatest influence over the organization's RULES. (In the same way the &quot;Technical Committee&quot; has the greatest influence on the organization's PROCESSES.)<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc10"><a name="Discussion points for an organizational framework-Membership"></a>Membership</h2>
 Membership in the organization iis open to all who agree to abide by the organization’s Code of Conduct. There might be categories of membership:<br />
<br />
<strong>Active Members</strong><br />
<ul><li>Have agreed to abide by the ethics statement/code of conduct</li><li>Valid e-mail address and project identity on file with the Membership Committee</li><li>Duty to vote on all member-wide circulars, asking questions and commenting as appropriate</li></ul><br />
<strong>Project Members</strong> (an Active Member participating in a specific Project Committee)<br />
<ul><li>Obligated to contribute to a Project Committee or Working Group</li><li>Duty to vote on Committee circulars, asking questions and commenting as appropriate</li><li>Agree to identify experts able to supplement the work of the Committee/Working Group</li></ul><br />
<strong>Advisory Members</strong> (by invitation of the Steering Committee, a Project Committee or Working Group)<br />
<ul><li>Have agreed to abide by the ethics statement/code of conduct</li><li>Advisory Members receive all member-wide circulars</li><li>Commenting is welcome, but not required.</li></ul><br />
<strong>Observing Members</strong><br />
<ul><li>Have agreed to abide by the ethics statement/code of conduct</li><li>Observing Members access member-wide circulars via wiki posting/wiki-notifications (requires registering e-mail address with the wiki and enabling wiki notifications).</li><li>Commenting is welcome, but not required.</li></ul><br />
Requires (1) protocol for circulars and tracking/reporting on circular votes, (2) means of registering valid e-mail address and project identity, (3) concept/mechanism/ability to gauge balance, and to outreach within the larger community to improve balance.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc11"><a name="Discussion points for an organizational framework-Consensus is a process of voting and commenting"></a>Consensus is a process of voting and commenting</h2>
 Project Committees develop written proposals that are to be circulated to appropriate Committees or to the full membership. (Generally, this follows the procedures established in the Technical Committee Proposal.) Circulars are distributed by the Membership Committee and returned with votes and comments to the Membership Committee, which is responsible for maintaining a record of the circular and results. (Note: The Management Committee must be able to tract the distribution and return of circulars in order to tabulate results.)<br />
<br />
<strong>Approvals at the Project Level</strong> (<span style="color: #cf0202;">allows the measure to pass to the full committee</span>).<br />
No fewer than seven (7) votes; at least XX% favorable votes. No return - a negative vote. (Project members have a duty to vote, so members who do not vote are then no longer a part of the Project Committee.)<br />
<br />
<strong>Approvals at the Standing Committee level</strong> (<span style="color: #cf0202;">allows the measure to pass to the full membership</span>).<br />
Not fewer than thirty-five (35) votes; at least XX% Favorable AND, no more than 1/4 of the Project Committee casts an unfavorable vote.<br />
<br />
<strong>Approvals at the Membership level</strong><br />
Not fewer than fifty (50) votes; at least 51% Favorable, AND, no more than 1/4 of the Technical Committee casts an unfavorable vote.<br />

The Technical Committee is responsible for establishing and administering standards/specification projects (Technical Projects), appointing Project Coordinators and determining the initial composition of Project Committee. Any Active Member with technical experience may be a member of the technical committee. One member of the Technical Committee is appointed as the Coordinator; another member acts as the Recorder. Three members of the Technical Committee are also members of the organization's Steering Committee. These appointments are made by XXXXX. Conceptually, the &quot;Technical Committee&quot; has the greatest influence over the organization's PROCESSES. (In the same way the &quot;Membership Committee&quot; has the greatest influence on the organization's RULES.)<br />

 Technical Projects are ideas that have been formalized into written proposals (requirements/scope, time and resource factors*) and for which sufficient members (number and balance) of the Technical Committee have committed to perform the necessary work. Technical Projects are then advanced by Project Committees made up of the Technical Committee members who have committed to work on the project and non-technical members (aka End Users) who also formally agree to work on a Technical Project. The recognized members of a Technical Project Team are considered Project Members.<br />
<br />
1. Typically seven (7) members of the Technical Committee must commit to work on a measure/project in order for a Project Committee to be created. (Sigh, sometimes it's only five.)<br />
2. The Technical Committee appoints the Project leadership by XXXX, including the roles of Coordinator and Recorder. The Technical Committee registers Project Committees with the Membership Committee (includes the initial written proposal and names of Project Committee Members and leadership).<br />
3. The Project Committee develops additional members--experts and non-technical members, so that most committees are made up of no fewer than XXX members. The names of the additional Project Committee members are also provided to the Management Committee.<br />
