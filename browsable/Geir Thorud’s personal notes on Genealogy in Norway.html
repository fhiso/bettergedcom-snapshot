<div class="title">Patronymics</div>
<div class="text">Geir,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this incredibly useful information. The experiences and special issues you deal with in your research are certainly different from what I am familiar with. Your perspective has already been very valuable, and personally, I have changed my mind completely on some things thanks to your input.<br/>
<br/>
In regard to patronymics, hasn't there been some major work on the use of patronymics in genealogical research lately? I was hoping that you would know about this, because I have heard of this subject being worked on, yet I am unable to track anything down. Perhaps it's because I'm only looking in English?</div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>gthorud</strong> 2010-12-04T07:18:35-08:00</div>
<div class="text">Greg,<br/>
<br/>
I have included a link to Wikipedia about patronymics on the page. Patronymics are more common than one may expect.<br/>
<br/>
I am not aware of any special recent work on patronymics. To me, this is not a big science, you simply use the given name of your father as a basis, and in a very few cases your mother's (matronymics). But I am sure there has been some work on statistics.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to note is that, in my view, special fields in programs for patronymics are not important - the important thing is to handle several surnames. This view seems to be supported by our National archives which do not operate with patronymics in source transcriptions. But I guess there are other views on this .... there has not been much discussion about this lately. <br/>
<br/>
And, there may be other experiences in other countries. Living in Europe, you quickly learn that there are several ways to do things.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>gthorud</strong> 2010-12-04T08:03:32-08:00</div>
<div class="text">Let me add that my thinking on "separate field for patronymic" is that proper handling of two surnames, eg. a name with two surnames should appear twice in a sorted list, would be a big step forward for patronymics - AND - it will be useful for other cases with two surnames. <br/>
<br/>
I have suggested a solution that may satisfy all views in my long list of issues on names - see <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2:http://bettergedcom.wikispaces.com/message/view/Person-Name+Elements/30777083 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://bettergedcom.wikispaces.com/message/view/Person-Name+Elements/30777083" rel="nofollow">http://bettergedcom.wikispaces.com/message/view/Person-Name+Elements/30777083</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2 --></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>greglamberson</strong> 2010-12-04T10:44:33-08:00</div>
<div class="text">gthorud,<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere somebody did some new work on patronymics in genealogy this year. I believe it had to do with properly sorting names, anticipating the proper suffix and/or automatically generating a child's patronymic name from a parent. Something like that.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>gthorud</strong> 2010-12-04T16:59:53-08:00</div>
<div class="text">Greg,<br/>
<br/>
The sorting issue is likely to be of interest.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure what the issue with prefixes are - what is a prefix in this context - son/datter? Here you will find three variants of son - son/sen/søn - no rule for what is correct. <br/>
<br/>
In my view, there is some distance between on one hand designing an evidence/conclusion model where one may need to enter a lot of names from sources for one person - and on the other hand generating names automatically. What is then left for genealogists to do? For me automatic generation of patronymics is technology looking for a problem to solve. <br/>
<br/>
There are periods of time here - from say 1850 to about 1930 - when you have no way of telling by any rule if a person ever used a patronymic.  <br/>
<br/>
There may be other needs in other countries, but I don't see the need here.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>GeneJ</strong> 2011-05-07T08:22:02-07:00</div>

<br/>
As Geir knows, my mother was a second generation born to Norwegian immigrants. I actually spun her family research into a separate project largely because of patronymics. <br/>
<br/>
It effects my Dutch lines in New Netherlands here on this side of the pond, too (so that in once case, we have two brothers, each opting to use a different surname).  <br/>
<br/>
Geir touched on two surnames in his posting; it may describe the situation on my fathers side where, probably with a little help from town clerks along the way, a family name Presbury became Presson and ultimately Preston. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps as you discover good and simple approaches for BetterGEDCOM to support these common surname issues.</div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>dsblank</strong> 2010-12-04T13:07:23-08:00</div>
<div class="title">BTW, Gramps has some of this</div>
<div class="text">Geir,<br/>
<br/>
Gramps 3.3 (coming in March 2011) has multiple surnames, farmnames, nicknames, callnames, patronymics, and matronymics. In addition, there are plugins for cultures to have surname guessing that follows the right rules. <br/>

<div class="text">Doug,<br/>
<br/>
I had seen that page, but did not note that it was for the next version, so I was sort of disappointed when I did not see the multiple surnames after I installed Gramps.<br/>
<br/>
I have not gone through all my issues with names and compared them to the Gramps solution, but it solves some of the issues.<br/>
<br/>
I note that there is no sorting on multiple surnames in Gramps, only on the primary one. Sorting on several would solve the need for having a primary surname, or am I wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have yet to understand the need to classify a surname as a patronymic. What is it used for?<br/>
<br/>
When we started to transcribe church records, we used a standard that had two surname fields - one patronymic and one family name (=same surname for parent and child,  and grandchild, inherited). Five years ago a new standard changed that to a single surname field - although a database may split that into several surnames since prefixes between surnames are very rare. The problem with the old way was that it was often not possible to tell if eg. Olsen was a patronymic or a family name. <br/>
<br/>
Genealogy programs will have the same problem, and since I do not see any use for the classification - the classification is not printed in any reports I have seen - why should we have it? It also complicates user interfaces.<br/>
<br/>
But this is in Norway, so I am not saying that no one, anywhere, has a use for it.<br/>
<br/>
I was not able to find any info about the plugins.</div></div><div class="comment"><div class="from"><strong>dsblank</strong> 2010-12-04T21:30:08-08:00</div>
<div class="text">Gramps does have many different types of plugins, but I misspoke about the surname guessing being one. Instead it is built-in, and set from menu -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Display -&gt; Surname Guessing. <br/>
<br/>
There are 4 built-in surname guessing styles types:<br/>
<br/>
1) None - no surname is guessed<br/>
2) Father's surname<br/>
3) Combination of Father's and Mother's surnames<br/>
4) Icelandic<br/>
<br/>
This could easily be turned into a plugin, or a new style can be added by adding a new function.<br/>
<br/>
The multiple-surnames is brand new (and as you point out, and isn't released to users yet); I suspect functionality (such as sorting) will follow. New reports are created all of the time. The important thing is to get the data into the database. Reports can be then developed as people design or request them. I don't use the patronymic, so I can't comment further.<br/>
