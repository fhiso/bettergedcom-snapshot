<strong>BetterGEDCOM</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>DEVELOPERS MEETING</strong><br />
<strong>20 June 2011</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
GeneJ: Activity on the wiki has progressed. Focus:<br />
<ul><li>Resolve conflicts in how E &amp; C is designed for BetterGEDCOM.</li><li>Renewed discussion bow E &amp; C relate to algorithms and auto-merge.</li><li>Gier’s “multi-tiered” approach to incorporate source materials AND logic.</li></ul>The logic that will be recorded will never get you to “the best evidence” – into one person. There is a gap between where the information is, and where current software. Evidence, conclusion and biography person – 3 styles.<br />
<br />
Today’s software permits recording of conclusions and publish biographies.<br />
<br />
Tamura:<br />
Make standards for what current genealogy programs do, but do differently. Then set standards for how to do it – all can comply.<br />
Do we want a better format – or do we want better research methods? Stick with better format.<br />
<br />
Ancestor Sync and GenBridge (MyHeritage+)<br />
<br />
GeneJ:<br />
If we don’t have standards, we won’t have online citations.<br />
